I found by chance this amazing [playlist about Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_HHYoWqerrLr3GG4eubXjjaJhfxw0fmu) by "[Jake Callahan](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_HHYoWqerrLr3GG4eubXjjaJhfxw0fmu)" channel on Youtube. He covers many topics in Python starting from the very beginning until to some advanced topics like Threading, Multiprocessing, Corutines, Metaclasses, etc. I decided to watch and take notes on some of these lesson because, even though I already know about Classes, Inheritance, Abstract Base Classes, etc, I think it is not bad to go over again these topics, especially since he has a neat and very precise way of explaining. I think that everyone explains things in their own way by emphasising the points that they think are most important, so I think that even if you listen to 100 different videos on the same subject, there is always something new to learn.

I therefore decided to create this collection of notes by watching his videos only on intermediate-advanced topics, neglecting, for now, more basic topics such as lectures on strings, lists, dictionaries without excluding that I will also follow those at some point.

As with all the notes in this blog, these ones are also created using Markdown and rendered by Quartz. However, Iâ€™ve decided to use Jupyter Notebooks as well so that I can interact with them and I pushed them into [this repository](https://github.com/simdangelo/obsidian-blog/tree/v4/content/Python/Understanding%20Python%20(by%20Jake%20Callahan)/jupyter_notebooks).
