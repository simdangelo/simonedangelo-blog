*Note: I usually am [using Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/simdangelo/obsidian-blog/tree/v4/content/Python/Understanding%20Python%20(by%20Jake%20Callahan)/jupyter_notebooks) to store all the codes I am using for this Python Playlist, but for this lesson I'm going to use a .py file because otherwise I would have had to reset the Jupyter kernel every time I changed the default level of the logger.*

---

Let's start Logging in Python by calling on `logging` the corresponding methods for the log level that we want to use:
```python
import logging

logging.debug("This is a debug message")
logging.info("This is an info message")
logging.warning("This is a warning message")
logging.error("This is an error message")
logging.critical("This is a critical message")
```

Here we have five different logging statements at five different logging levels. If we run this code, we'll see only messages referred to warning, error and critical level:
```
WARNING:root:This is a warning message
ERROR:root:This is an error message
CRITICAL:root:This is a critical message
```

The reason is that the default log level of Python's logger is **warning**, meaning that anything below warning in severity is ignored. So, even that we've made calls on debug and info level, the logger checks to see if each of those levels is at or above its current log level and then decide if its' going to process the log message or not. This is one of the greatest advantages versus just using `print()` function, that is you can easily toggle the level of messages that your app is going to give out. Furthermore you don't need to worry about adding and then removing or just commenting a bunch of `print()` statements in your codebase, and you can just instead add different level log statements and modify you logging level at runtime.

Let's see how to modify this log level of this default logger:
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

logging.debug("This is a debug message")
logging.info("This is an info message")
logging.warning("This is a warning message")
logging.error("This is an error message")
logging.critical("This is a critical message")
```
Output:
```
INFO:root:This is an info message
WARNING:root:This is a warning message
ERROR:root:This is an error message
CRITICAL:root:This is a critical message
```

Let's talk about these levels:
+ `debug`: this is typically detailed information that most users likely shouldn't see such as API responses, important variable values, or anything you think would be useful to help you track down potential bugs in your program by tracing your program's execution.
+ `info`: this is typically the level most people set their debuggers to because this level should show program information that users are more likely interested in. These messages should also show normal program flow and success.
+ `warning`: these are typically problems that your program can adjust to. Things that the user likely should take some action to avoid in the future. Some examples are deprecation messages.
+ `error`: these are typically exceptions or other errors the program encounters at runtime These are likely going to be followed by raising some exception, but not always.
+ `critical`: these are rarely seen and they are fatal exceptions or system level issues. There's a bit of a blur between what constitutes an error and what constitutes a critical.

Let's analyze better this line `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)`. `INFO` is uppercase because it's a constant. Let's take a look at it in the IPython shell:
```terminal
>>> logging.DEBUG
10
>>> logging.INFO
20
>>> logging.WARNING
30
>>> logging.ERROR
40
>>> logging.CRITICAL
50
```

This means that the piece of code we are analyzing can be replaced with `logging.basicConfig(level=20)`. Alternatively, there's another way to do the same, that is just use the uppercase version of the level you want to use between quotes: `logging.basicConfig(level="INFO")`.

It's possible to see the corresponding integer value to each logging level with:
```terminal
>>> logging._nameToLevel
{'CRITICAL': 50,
 'FATAL': 50,
 'ERROR': 40,
 'WARN': 30,
 'WARNING': 30,
 'INFO': 20,
 'DEBUG': 10,
 'NOTSET': 0}
```
This provides a handy dictionary which Python uses to lookup the corresponding value.
# Formatting
Let's make the logger messages more interesting by customizing its behaviour. Firstly, let's give a name to the logger:
```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(name="myapp")

logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```
Output:
```
This is a warning message
This is an error message
This is a critical message
```

Note that
+ we lost both the debug and info level messages. The reason is that we haven't actually set a log level for our `logger` and, since we're also not setting on Python's default logger, it now falls back to its original default of only logging messages that are warning and higher. To solve this we'll use `.set_Level()` method. Let's fix it:
```python
logger = logging.getLogger(name="myapp")
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
```
+ we lost the message formatting we had previously. Let's add some information to our log messages by creating our own formatter with `Formatter()` method, where `fmt` indicates the format of the message and `style` is necessary because Python needs to know what type of string replacement it needs to use to format the log message:
```python
formatter = logging.Formatter(
    fmt="[{levelname} {name} {asctime}] {message}",
)
```

Now, we need to make a new Handler, that is an object that actually emit the log messages themselves. In this case we'll use the default one. Then we'll set the formatter and then we'll add this handler object to the logger:
```python
handler = logging.StreamHandler()
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(handler)
```

Output:
```terminal
[INFO myapp 2024-11-01 22:07:20,616] This is an info message
[WARNING myapp 2024-11-01 22:07:20,616] This is a warning message
[ERROR myapp 2024-11-01 22:07:20,616] This is an error message
[CRITICAL myapp 2024-11-01 22:07:20,616] This is a critical message
```

We can customize logger messages even more by specifying the date format in the formatter:
```python
formatter = logging.Formatter(
    fmt="[{levelname} {name} {asctime}] {message}",
    datefmt="%H:%M:%S",
    style="{",
)
```
Here's the output, which is more clean:
```
[INFO myapp 14:49:27] This is an info message
[WARNING myapp 14:49:27] This is a warning message
[ERROR myapp 14:49:27] This is an error message
[CRITICAL myapp 14:49:27] This is a critical message
```

Now the log messages look great, but all these log messages are cluttering up standard output, meaning that logging messages are being printed to the console (which is standard output) along with other important output the program might have. This can make it hard to see whatâ€™s relevant, as too many log messages can fill up the screen and make it difficult to read the actual results of the program. We can easily remedy by switching from logging everything to standard out by default to standard error by default. To make this, let's import `sys` and let's modify the `handler` object:
```python
import logging
import sys

logger = logging.getLogger(name="myapp")
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

formatter = logging.Formatter(
    fmt="[{levelname} {name} {asctime}] {message}",
    datefmt="%H:%M:%S",
    style="{",
)

handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stderr)
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(handler)

logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```
Output:
```
[INFO myapp 16:07:30] This is an info message
[WARNING myapp 16:07:30] This is a warning message
[ERROR myapp 16:07:30] This is an error message
[CRITICAL myapp 16:07:30] This is a critical message
```

Note that this output is not different from the one above. However, since we're on Linux, we can do some things to test this out. Firstly, let's add two print statements:
```python
print("I'm here first!")

logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")

print("I'm here last!")
```

Now, since `print()` by default is going to go to standard out, we'll redirect:
* `1` (or standard out) to a file called `stdout.log`
* `2` (or standard error) to a file called `stderr.log` and 2

To do so, we'll hit in the terminal:
```bash
python 37.\ Logging\ Basics.py 1> stdout.log 2> stderr.log
```

This command creates two new files, one containing only print statements output and the other only logs messages:

![](Python/Understanding%20Python%20(by%20Jake%20Callahan)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241102162321.png)

This way you can keep things like standard out clean for things that use your app for automation, but you can still use standard error to present information to the console that looks like it's mixed in with everything else. However, we don't have to stop there because one of the great advantages of using logging is to be able to log to files. To log a file we'll create `file_handler` object and we'll use the same `formatter` object we used before:
```python
file_handler = logging.FileHandler("myapp.log")
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
```

Furthermore we can also set different log level for file handler and then we'll add this file handler to the logger (because we can have multiple handlers per logger):
```python
file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logger.addHandler(file_handler)
```

So, when we call, for example, `logger.warning("This is a warning message")`, the logger is passing this log message not only to the `StreamHandler`, but also to `FileHandler`. However, this isn't going to work yet because, even though the `FileHandler` is set to `DEBUG`, our main logger is still set to `INFO`; so when we call `logger.debug("...")`, the logger itself is never going to pass that along even though our underlying handler is at a lower level. In order to fix this, we're going to set our logger to the lowest level that we want any of our handlers at (`logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)`) and our handlers need to have specific levels for each other. So, what we'll do is to set a new level for our original `handler` object setting it to `INFO` and this way, when we call `logger.debug("This is a debug message")`, it's going to pass. that debug message along to both our handlers:
+ our `StreamHandler` (that is `handler`) will not do anything with it because it's set to `INFO`;
+ our `FileHandler` (that is `file_handler`) is going to take that and log it out because it is set to `DEBUG`.

Let's rewrite the full corrected code:
```python
import logging
import sys

logger = logging.getLogger(name="myapp")
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

formatter = logging.Formatter(
    fmt="[{levelname} {name} {asctime}] {message}",
    datefmt="%H:%M:%S",
    style="{",
)

handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stderr)
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
logger.addHandler(handler)

file_handler = logging.FileHandler("myapp.log")
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logger.addHandler(file_handler)

print("I'm here first!")

logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")

print("I'm here last!")
```

Then let's run again:
```bash
python 37.\ Logging\ Basics.py 1> stdout.log 2> stderr.log
```

The console will look exactly the same as before:
```
I'm here first!
[INFO myapp 17:15:23] This is an info message
[WARNING myapp 17:15:23] This is a warning message
[ERROR myapp 17:15:23] This is an error message
[CRITICAL myapp 17:15:23] This is a critical message
I'm here last!
```

However, the file `myapp.log` will contain not only the log messages we have in our console, but also the debug level message: 
![](Python/Understanding%20Python%20(by%20Jake%20Callahan)/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241102171821.png)

This also shows the separation between our standard out printed messages and our log messages.
