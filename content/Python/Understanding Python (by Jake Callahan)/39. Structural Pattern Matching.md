# Literal Pattern
**Structural Pattern Matching** is a powerful replacement for if/elif/else and the easiest way to get started with that is by matching a single value:
```python
import random

match random.randint(0, 10):
    case 5:
        print("Lucky!")
```

In this case we're going to match against the output of `random.randint(0, 10)` with all different match cases and it is executed from top to bottom.

# Or Pattern
Let's add a new case by using the **Or Pattern**:
```python
match random.randint(0, 10):
    case 5:
        print("Lucky!")
    case 4 | 6:
        print("You got close!")
```

# Capture Pattern
When we got "*You got close*" we don't know if 4 or 6 is chosen, so let's add another piece of syntax to let us know which one we actually got:
```python
match random.randint(0, 10):
    case 5:
        print("Lucky!")
    case 4 | 6 as num:
        print(f"You got close with {num}!")
```
In this case, `as num`is going to capture whichever one of those matched and store that random number into this variable.

Now let's cover case where we didn't hit 5, 4 or 6 specifically we want to see if we got at least an odd number:
```python
match random.randint(0, 10):
    case 5:
        print("Lucky!")
    case 4 | 6 as num:
        print(f"You got close with {num}!")
    case num if num % 2 != 0:
        print(f"at least {num} was odd.")
```

Note that:
+ the `if` statement in the structural pattern matching language is called **Guard**. In this case it tries to match against anything, but guarded with a condition.
+ if we remove the `if` statement in the last case clause, we got the so-called **Capture Pattern** because `num` it's going to match against anything.
# Wildcard Pattern
The last common pattern is called **Wildcard**, represented by `_`, that is going to match everything again except we're not going to put any guards on it and it doesn't bind to a variable:
```python
match random.randint(0, 10):
    case 5:
        print("Lucky!")
    case 4 | 6 as num:
        print(f"You got close with {num}!")
    case num if num % 2 != 0:
        print(f"at least {num} was odd.")
    case _:
        print("You missed!")
```

Actually, if you do care about this last case and don't want to just have a blank wildcard to fall back to, you can still have that wildcard behaviour and you can handle this in this way:
```python
match random.randint(0, 10):
    case 5:
        print("Lucky!")
    case 4 | 6 as num:
        print(f"You got close with {num}!")
    case num if num % 2 != 0:
        print(f"at least {num} was odd.")
    case _ as miss: # or simply "case miss:"
        print(f"You missed with {miss}!")
```
or simply `case miss:` instead of `case _ as miss:`.

What happens if we add the wildcard pattern as last case match? The IDE marks `case miss:` as a error saying "Irrefutable pattern is allowed only for the last case statement" and that's because we have two cases `case miss` and `case _` that match everything:
```python
match random.randint(0, 10):
    case 5:
        print("Lucky!")
    case 4 | 6 as num:
        print(f"You got close with {num}!")
    case num if num % 2 != 0:
        print(f"at least {num} was odd.")
    case miss:
        print(f"You missed with {miss}!")
    case _:
        print("Fail")
```

This could be a good way for us to check to make sure tat we don't have cases within our patterns that are going to be more general than you're expecting. For example, we would have the same error with this code:
```python
match random.randint(0, 10):
    case 5:
        print("Lucky!")
    case 4 | 6 as num:
        print(f"You got close with {num}!")
    case miss:
        print(f"You missed with {miss}!")
    case num if num % 2 != 0:
        print(f"at least {num} was odd.")
```
