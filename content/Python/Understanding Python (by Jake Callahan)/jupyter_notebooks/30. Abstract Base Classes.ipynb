    "How exactly is this working? In the lesson about metaclasses (*TODO: inserisci link*), near the end we defined a class that was effectively the reverse version of an abstract base class and in that example if a child class tried to override a method that was defined on the parent, it would stop it from being created. What Python does is it has ABC, which has a metaclass defined of ABC.meta and that metaclass will check through and see if there's any abtract methods that are still in the class that's trying to be instantiated and, if they are, it's going to raise that `TypeError`. For the very same reason, we can't create an instance of `Shape` because it has two of these abstract methofs intact. On the other hand, the reason why `Circle` and `Triangle` can be instantiated is because they're overriding the definition that's provided on their parent."
