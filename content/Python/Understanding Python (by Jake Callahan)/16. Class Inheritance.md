**Inheritance** is a powerful feature that allows us to use functionality from another class or from multiple classes.

Let's define a simple class that we can initialize by passing any keyword arguments that we want and it will add those arguments to the class's dictionary attribute, allowsing them to be dot-accessible:
```python
class LooseInit:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        self.__dict__.update(kwargs)
```

If we want to use this functionality in another class, we have to inherit from this class:
```python
class Child(LooseInit):
    pass
```

We can create an instance of this class to use this functionality:
```python
sister = Child(name="Kiara", age=13)
brother = Child(name="Hunter", age=15)

print(f"{sister.name} is {sister.age} years old.")
print(f"{brother.name} is {brother.age} years old.")
```
Output:
```
Kiara is 13 years old.
Hunter is 15 years old.
```

Inheritance becomes more powerful when you inherit from multiple classes. So let's define another class:
```python
class Utils:
    @classmethod
    def from_dict(cls, arg_dict):
        return cls(**arg_dict)
    
    def to_dict(self):
        return {
            key: value for key, value in self.__dict__.items() if not key.startswith("_")
        }
```
* `from_dict` method allows us to create an instance of a class by passing in a dictionary of key to value arguments
* `to_dict` method allows us to create a dictionary with all non-private attributes of a class.

Now, let our `Child` class to inherit from this new class too:
```python
class Child(LooseInit, Utils):
    pass
```

Now let's use both these two new methods:
```python
cousin = Child.from_dict({"name": "Amanda", "age": 16})
sister = Child(name="Kiara", age=13)

print(f"{cousin.name} is {cousin.age} years old.")
print(f"sister dict: {sister.to_dict()}")
```
Output:
```
Amanda is 16 years old.
sister dict: {'name': 'Kiara', 'age': 13}
```

Say we want to control the input that's going into the class during the instantiation, without touching the `LooseInit` class. To do so, we'll define a new class before the `Child` class:
```python
class StrictInit(LooseInit):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        sanitized_args = {
            key: value for key, value in kwargs.items() if not key.startswith("bad")
        }
```

What we have done here is to store unwanted arguments that were passed into our class and store into a new variable called `sanitized_args`. However, we lost the funcionality of `LooseInit`, that is add all keyword arguments to the class's dictionary attribute. Instead of we-writing that functionality, Python provides the `super()` method:
```python
class StrictInit(LooseInit):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        sanitized_args = {
            key: value for key, value in kwargs.items() if not key.startswith("bad")
        }
        super().__init__(**sanitized_args)

class Child(StrictInit, Utils):
    pass

sister = Child(name="Kiara", age=13, bad_args="asdf")
print(f"sister dict: {sister.to_dict()}")
```
Outpu:
```
sister dict: {'name': 'Kiara', 'age': 13}
```

As we can see the keyword argument `bad_args` was not stored into the class's dictionary attribute.

Let's say now we don't like all these print statements, so we'll write a new class that allows us to print things a bit better by overriding the `__repr__` dunder method, which is part of every class in Python:
```python
class BetterRepr(Utils):
    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        output = ''
        for key, value in self.to_dict().items():
            output += f"{key}: {value}, "
        return f"<{output[:-2]}>"
```

What `__repr__` does is it controls what's returned when you call for a string representation of an object. Notice that we're using `to_dict()` method of `Utils` class because we're inheriting from class and so we can use all methods of that class.

Now let's let the `Child` class inherit from `BetterRepr` as well and then we'll create some instances of that class:
```python
class Child(StrictInit, BetterRepr):
    pass

sister = Child(name="Kiara", age=13, bad_arg="asdf")
brother = Child(name="Hunter", age=15)
cousin = Child.from_dict({"name": "Amanda", "age": 17})

print(f"sister - {sister}")
print(f"brother - {brother}")
print(f"cousin - {cousin}")
```
Output:
```
sister - <name: Kiara, age: 13>
brother - <name: Hunter, age: 15>
cousin - <name: Amanda, age: 17>
```

We can also add one of these instances as attribute of any other instances:
```python
sister.cousin = cousin
brother.cousin = cousin

print(f"sister - {sister}")
print(f"brother - {brother}")
```
Output:
```
sister - <name: Kiara, age: 13, cousin: <name: Amanda, age: 17>>
brother - <name: Hunter, age: 15, cousin: <name: Amanda, age: 17>>
```

Now let's add a new method to `StrictInit` as well as `BetterRepr` classes:
```python
class StrictInit(LooseInit):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        sanitized_args = {
            key: value for key, value in kwargs.items() if not key.startswith("bad")
        }
        super().__init__(**sanitized_args)

    def print_cls(self):
        print("StrictInit")

class BetterRepr(Utils):
    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        output = ''
        for key, value in self.to_dict().items():
            output += f"{key}: {value}, "
        return f"<{output[:-2]}>"
    
    def print_cls(self):
        print("BetterRepr")

class Child(StrictInit, BetterRepr):
    pass

sister = Child(name="Kiara", age=13, bad_arg="asdf")

print("Calling print_cls method")
sister.print_cls()
```
Output:
```
Calling print_cls method
StrictInit
```

We can look that `Child` inherits from both `StrictInit` and `BetterRepr` classes, but it return `StrictInit` string when `print_cls()` method is called. That's because Python resolves `StrictInit` before it does `BetterRepr`. If we swap the twos in the `Child` class definition, the `print_cls` method will return `BetterRepr` string:
```python
class Child(BetterRepr, StrictInit):
    pass

sister = Child(name="Kiara", age=13, bad_arg="asdf")

print("Calling print_cls method")
sister.print_cls()
```
Output:
```
Calling print_cls method
BetterRepr
```

Let's understand why this happens. Let's paste all the classes we wrote so far and then let's print the **MRO** of the `Child` class, that tells us which order Python looks to find the funcionality in the class:
```python
class LooseInit:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.__dict__.update(kwargs)

class StrictInit(LooseInit):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        sanitized_args = {
            key: value for key, value in kwargs.items()
            if not key.startswith("bad")
        }
        super().__init__(**sanitized_args)

    def print_cls(self):
        print("StrictInit")

class Utils:
    @classmethod
    def from_dict(cls, arg_dict):
        return cls(**arg_dict)

    def to_dict(self):
        return {
            key: value
            for key, value in self.__dict__.items()
            if not key.startswith("_")
        }

class BetterRepr(Utils):
    def __repr__(self):
        output = ""
        for key, value in self.to_dict().items():
            output += f"{key}: {value}, "
        return f"<{output[:-2]}>"

    def print_cls(self):
        print("BetterRepr")


class Child(BetterRepr, StrictInit):
    pass

Child.mro()
```
Output:
```
[__main__.Child
__main__.BetterRepr,
__main__.Utils,
__main__.StrictInit,
__main__.LooseInit,
object]
```

We can see that:
* it starts from the `Child`
* then it goes to `BetterRepr`, because `Child` inherits from `BetterRepr`
* then it goes to `Utils`, because `BetterRepr` inherits from `Utils`

So far, it's going to the left-side of the inheritance. Now it will go to the right-side:
* it goes to `StrictInit`
* then it goes to `LooseInit`, because `StrictInit` inherits from `LooseInit`
* then all classes within Python eventually inherit from the `object` class, which is a built-in class in Python and it provides a lot of base funcionalities.

Let's represent it graphically:
```
  Utils         LooseInit
    |               |
 BetterRepr    StrictInit
         \     /
          Child
```

There's another thing that can trip you up when it comes to the MRO order. We'll make a new `Nothing` class and lets the `BetterRepr` inherits from it:
```python
class Nothing:
    pass

class BetterRepr(Nothing, Utils):
    def __repr__(self):
        output = ""
        for key, value in self.to_dict().items():
            output += f"{key}: {value}, "
        return f"<{output[:-2]}>"

    def print_cls(self):
        print("BetterRepr")


class Child(BetterRepr, StrictInit):
    pass

Child.mro()
```
Output:
```
[__main__.Child,
__main__.BetterRepr,
__main__.Nothing,
__main__.Utils,
__main__.StrictInit,
__main__.LooseInit,
object]
```

This result is what we expected and we can see graphically as well:
```
Nothing  Utils     LooseInit
  \       /           |
  BetterRepr    StrictInit
         \     /
          Child
```

But, what happens if `StrictInit` inherits from `Nothing` as well?
```python
class Nothing:
    pass

class LooseInit:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.__dict__.update(kwargs)

class StrictInit(LooseInit, Nothing):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        sanitized_args = {
            key: value for key, value in kwargs.items()
            if not key.startswith("bad")
        }
        super().__init__(**sanitized_args)

    def print_cls(self):
        print("StrictInit")

class Utils:
    @classmethod
    def from_dict(cls, arg_dict):
        return cls(**arg_dict)

    def to_dict(self):
        return {
            key: value
            for key, value in self.__dict__.items()
            if not key.startswith("_")
        }

class BetterRepr(Nothing, Utils):
    def __repr__(self):
        output = ""
        for key, value in self.to_dict().items():
            output += f"{key}: {value}, "
        return f"<{output[:-2]}>"

    def print_cls(self):
        print("BetterRepr")


class Child(BetterRepr, StrictInit):
    pass

Child.mro()
```
Output:
```
[__main__.Child,
__main__.BetterRepr,
__main__.StrictInit,
__main__.LooseInit,
__main__.Nothing,
__main__.Utils,
object]
```

Before giving explanation, let's represent it graphically:
```
Nothing    Utils   LooseInit   Nothing
    \       /          \      /
    BetterRepr      StrictInit
             \     /
              Child
```

The result now is different from what we expected. Since MRO goes from the left-side to the right-side we expected to see `Nothing` after `BetterRepr`. What happens is that adding the `Nothing` to `StrictInit` brought the `Nothing` class higher in the MRO; actually it will put as high as possible. So, Python will wait to resolve `Nothing` until all other classes (`StrictInit` and its ancestors) are also considered.

As a rule you have to remember that when it comes to the MRO, when you have common parents, those parents will be moved above any other parents on the same level.
