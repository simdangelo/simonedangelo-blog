In the programming world, **Duplicate Code** is considered evil. There are many ways to merge pieces of code or objects that have similar functionality. One of them is **Inheritance**.

>[!definition]
>**Inheritance** allows us to create "**IS-A**" relationship between two or more classes, abstracting common logic into superclasses and extending the superclass with specific details in each subclass.

# Basic Inheritance
Technically, every class we create uses **Inheritance**.
>[!info]
>**All Python classes are subclasses of the special built-in class** named **`object`**.

This class provide a little bit of metadata and a few built-in behaviours (such as `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__repr__`, among others.) so Python can treat all objects consistently. To prove that:
```python
class MyClass:
    pass
    
print(issubclass(MyClass, object)) # This will print: True
```

In Python 3, all classes automatically inherit from `object` if we don't explicitly provide a different **superclass** (or **parent class**).
* The **Superclass** is the class that is being inherited from.
* The **Subclass** is the class that inherits from the superclass. it is said that the subclass **extends** the parent class.

Let's see some uses of inheritance
### Add functionality to an existing class:
Let's create the `Contact` class:
```python
from typing import List

class Contact:
    all_contacts: List["Contact"] = []

    def __init__(self, name: str, email: str) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        Contact.all_contacts.append(self)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}({self.name!r}, {self.email!r})"


contact1 = Contact("John Doe", "john@example.com")
contact2 = Contact("Jane Doe", "jane@example.com")

print(Contact.all_contacts)
```
Output:
```
[Contact('John Doe', 'john@example.com'), Contact('Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com')]
```
Among all the contacts there could be some that are suppliers that we need to order supplies from. We could add an `order` method to the `Contact` class, but that would allow people to order things from contacts that are not suppliers. Solution: **create a new `Supplier` class** that acts like `Contact` class, but **has an additional `order` method** that accepts a yet-to-be defined `Order` object:
```python
class Supplier(Contact):
    def order(self, order: "Order") -> None:
        print("{order} send to '{self.name}'")
```
With this setup, all the contacts, including suppliers, accept a name and email address in their constructor, but only `Supplier` instances have he `order` method:
```python
c = Contact("AContactName", "acontact@gmail.com")
s = Supplier("ASupplierName", "asupplier@gmail.com")

pprint(c.all_contacts)
print()
s.order("I need pliers")
```
Output:
```
[Contact('John Doe', 'john@example.com'),
 Contact('Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com'),
 Contact('AContactName', 'acontact@gmail.com'),
 Supplier('ASupplierName', 'asupplier@gmail.com')]

I need pliers send to 'ASupplierName'
```

> [!info] Class Variable
> A **Class Variable** is shared by all instances of this class and it has collected instance of both `Contact` and `Supplier` classes.
### Extending built-ins
#### Example 1: Extending `list`
How to search a specific name within the list of contacts? Instead of instantiating a generic list as our class variable, we create a new `ContactList` class that **extends the built-in `list` data type**:
```python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List


class ContactList(list["Contact"]):
    def search(self, name: str) -> list["Contact"]:
        matching_contacts: list["Contact"] = []
        for contact in self:
            if name in contact.name:
                matching_contacts.append(contact)
        return matching_contacts
    
class Contact:
    all_contacts = ContactList()

    def __init__(self, name: str, email: str) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        Contact.all_contacts.append(self)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}({self.name!r}, {self.email!r})"


contact1 = Contact("John Doe", "john@example.com")
contact2 = Contact("Jane Doe", "jane@example.com")
contact2 = Contact("Mary Jane", "mary@example.com")

[c.name for c in Contact.all_contacts.search("Doe")]
```
Output:
```
['John Doe', 'Jane Doe']
```
#### Example 2: Extending `dict`
How to tracks the longest key in a dictionary?
```python
from typing import Optional

class LongNameDict(dict[str, int]):
    def longest_key(self) -> Optional[str]:
        longest = None
        for key in self:
            if longest is None or len(key) > len(longest):
                longest = key
        return longest
    

articles_read = LongNameDict()
articles_read["lucy"] = 42
articles_read["c_c_phillips"] = 6
articles_read["steve"]= 7

articles_read.longest_key()
```
Output:
```
'c_c_phillips'
```
You can also use a more generic dictionary with either strings or integers:
```python
from typing import Union

class LongNameDict(dict[str, Union[str, int]]):
	...
```
## Overriding and `super()`
Inheritance is great for adding new behaviour, as we have already seen, and for **changing behaviour** too.

It's possible to make a third variable available on initialization by overriding the `__init__()` method:
```python
class Friend(Contact):
	def __init__(self, name: str, email: str, phone: str) -> None:
		self.name = name
		self.email = email
		self.phone = phone
```
But that's not the best solution since duplicated code is created. Indeed we need a way to execute the original `__init__()` method on the `Contact` class from inside the new `Friend` class:
```python
class Friend(Contact):
	def __init__(self, name: str, email: str, phone: str) -> None:
		super().__init__(name, email)
		self.phone = phone

	def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}({self.name!r}, {self.email!r}, {self.phone!r})"


aFriend = Friend("tizio", "tizio@gmail.com", "123456789")
Contact.all_contacts
```
Output:
```
[Contact('John Doe', 'john@example.com'),
 Contact('Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com'),
 Contact('Mary Jane', 'mary@example.com'),
 Friend('tizio', 'tizio@gmail.com', '123456789')]
```
Note that we have also overridden the `__repr__()` method to guarantee a proper visualization of the new `Friend` class instances.
# Multiple Inheritance

# Polymorphism

Polymorphism means taking different forms. In programming, it enables operators, functions, and methods to act differently when subjected to different conditions.

Polymorphism in Python can manifest in some ways.
### 1. Duck Typing
Python is known for its **"Duck Typing" Philosophy**, which is a form of polymorphism where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. When you use an object's method without knowing its type, as long as the object supports the method invocation, Python will run it. This is often summarized as "*If looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck*".

**Example** 1: `+` operator.
The `+` operator can perform addition two numbers or concatenate two strings depending on the operand types:
```python
result = 1 + 2
print(result) # Output: 3

result = "Hello + World!"
print(result) # Output: Hello World!
```
The `+` operator's polymorphism capability enables it to identify the inputs and perform operations accordingly.

**Example 2**: Python built-in functions.
Python built-in functions provide polymorphism, such as the `len()` function:
```python
print(len("Hello World!")) # Output: 12
print(len([1,2,3,4])) # Output: 4
print(len({"Name": "John", "Surname": "Doe"})) # Output: 2
```
The `len()` function works differently when passed different input.
### 2. Polymorphism with class methods
We can free to create our own functions that show polymorphism. In this example, we'll create class methods to showcase polymorphism:
```python
class Dog:
	def speak(self):
		print("Woof!")

class Cat:
	def speak(self):
		print("Meow!")

def animal_sound(animal):
	animal.speak()


aDog = Dog()
aCat = Cat()
animal_sound(aDog)
animal_sound(aCat)
```
In this example, the `animal_sound` function can call the `speak` method on any object passed to it, demonstrating polymorphism through **duck typing**. The function does not need to know the type of the object in advance, only that it can perform the action expected of it.
### 3. Polymorphism with Inheritance
When a child class extends a superclass, it uses method overriding polymorphism to implement inheritance. Basically, polymorphism allows different classes to have methods with the same name but with different implementations:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DataProcessor(ABC):
	@abstractmethod
	def process_data(self, data):
		pass

class NumericDataProcessor(DataProcessor):
	def process_data(self, data):
		return [x*2 for x in data]

class TextDataProcessor(DataProcessor):
	def process_data(self, data):
		return [s.upper() for s in data]

def process_all(data_processor, data):
	return data_processor.process_data(data)


numeric_processor = NumericDataProcessor()
text_processor = TextDataProcessor()
numeric_data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
text_data = ['python', 'data']

print(process_all(numeric_processor, numeric_data))
print(process_all(text_processor, text_data))
```
Output:
```
[2, 4, 6, 8]
['PYTHON', 'DATA']
```
In this example, the `process_all` function doesn't need to know the type of data it is processing. It relies on polymorphism to call the appropriate `process_data` method based on the object it passed to it.
