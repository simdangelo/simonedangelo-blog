# Treat objects as objects
Standard approach in Object-Oriented Analysis and Programming: identify objects in the problem, and then model their data and behaviours. However, it isn't always as easy.

You can proceed like that:
+ store data in a few variables;
+ if you will pass the same set of related variables to a set of function, you can think about grouping both variables and functions into a **class**.

**Example**: start to think of a polygon as a set of points. To compute the perimeter, you need to compute the distance between each point:
```python
from __future__ import annotations
from math import hypot
from typing import Tuple, List

Point = Tuple[float, float]

def distance(p_1: Point, p_2: Point) -> float:
	return hypot(p_1[0]-p_2[0], p_1[1]-p_2[1])

square = [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1)]
Polygon = List[Point]

def perimeter(polygon: Polygon) -> float:
	pairs = zip(polygon, polygon[1:]+polygon[:1])
	return sum(distance(p1,p2) for p1, p2 in pairs)

perimeter(square)
```
Output:
```
4.0
```
*(I honestly didn't understand the effect of `from __future__ import annotations` in the above example)*

Looking at the code above, we notice that
* a new  `Polygon` class could encapsulate the list of points (**data**) and the `perimeter` function (**behaviour**);
* a new `Point` class could encapsulate the x and y coordinates (**data**) and the `distance` function (**behaviour**):
```python
from math import hypot
from __future__ import annotations

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y) -> None:
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def distance(self, other: Point) -> float:
        return hypot(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)
    
class Polygon:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.vertices: List[Point] = []

    def add_point(self, point: Point) -> None:
        self.vertices.append(point)

    def perimeter(self) -> float:
        pairs = zip(self.vertices, self.vertices[1:] + self.vertices[:1])
        return sum(p1.distance(p2) for p1, p2 in pairs)
    

square = Polygon()
square.add_point(Point(1,1))
square.add_point(Point(1,2))
square.add_point(Point(2,2))
square.add_point(Point(2,1))
square.perimeter()
```
Output:
```terminal
4.0
```
*(Now, it makes sense to use `from __future__ import annotations ` because in the `distance` method I'm using `Point` class that is not already defined).*

Although the latter OOP code appears longer and less compact than the former, it is much more readable and easy to understand because the relationship among the objects are more clearly defined by hints. Code length is not a goof indicator of code complexity.
# Adding behaviours to class with properties
*(I feel that topics like **setters**, **getters**, an **properties** are not clearly explained in the book, so I preferred to write two separate note articles about these topics: [Setters and Getters](Python/Single%20Topics/Setters%20and%20Getters.md) and [Properties](Python/Single%20Topics/Properties.md)*).
## Deciding when to use properties
The built-in `property` blurs the division between behaviour and data, so it can be confusing to understand when to choose an attribute, or a method, or a property. Some suggestions:
+ use **methods** to represent **actions**. A method should *do something*. Method names are generally verbs.
+ use **attributes** or **properties** to represent the **state of the object**:
	+ use ordinary attribute, initialized in the `__init__()` method, to immediately provide that attribute to an instance;
	+ use properties when there is a computation involved with setting or getting. Examples include data validation, logging, cache management.

Let's look at a realistic example: **caching a value that is difficult or expensive to calculate**. Indeed, the goal is to store locally this value to avoid repeated expensive calls. We'll do this with a **custom getter** on the property.
```python
from urllib.request import urlopen
from typing import Optional, cast

class WebPage:
    def __init__(self, url: str) -> None:
        self.url = url
        self._content = Optional[bytes] = None

    @property
    def content(self) -> bytes:
        if self._content is not None:
            print("Retrieving New Page...")
            with urlopen(self.url) as response:
                self._content = response.read()
        return self._content
```
With this property we'll only read the website content once because `self._content` is initially empty. Now `self._content` is no more empty so it's not re-computed, so it will not be recomputed after the first call. Let's verify this:
```python
import time

webpage = WebPage("http://ccphillips.net/")

now = time.perf_counter()
content1 = webpage.content
first_fetch = time.perf_counter() - now


now = time.perf_counter()
content2 = webpage.content
second_fetch = time.perf_counter() - now

assert content2 == content1
print(f"First fetch: {first_fetch:.5}")
print(f"Second fetch: {second_fetch:.5}")
```
Output:
```
Retrieving New Page...
First fetch: 0.27059
Second fetch: 3.325e-05
```

Another example of another **custom getter**: calculate some attributes based on other object attributes:
```python
from typing import List

class AverageList(List[int]):
    @property
    def average(self) -> float:
        return sum(self) / len(self)
    
aList = AverageList([10, 5, 2])
aList.average # Output: 5.666666666666667
```
