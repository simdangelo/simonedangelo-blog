The philosophical idea behind **Abstraction** is that it's a way to **summarize complexity**. A sailboat and an airplane have a common, abstract relationship of being vehicles, but they differ a lot as vehicles. In Python, we have two approaches to defining similar things:
* **Duck Typing** (already discussed [here](Technical%20Books/Python%20Object-Oriented%20Programming/03.%20When%20Objects%20Are%20Alike.md#1.%20Duck%20Typing)): briefly "*If looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck*".
* **Inheritance**: when two class definitions have common aspects, a subclass can share common features of a superclass. The implementation details of the two classes may vary, but the classes should be interchangeable when we use the common features defined by the superclass.

We can take **Inheritance** one step further: we can have superclass definition that are **Abstract**, meaning that they're not directly usable, but they can be used through inheritance to create concrete class. Let's make a visual example of inheritance:

![](Technical%20Books/Python%20Object-Oriented%20Programming/attachments/python-oop.drawio%20(2).svg)

+ our base class `BaseClass` has a special class, `abc.ABC` as parent class. This provides some special metaclass features that help make sure the concrete class have replaces the abstractions;
+ the abstract `BaseClass` has an abstract method, `a_method()`, which doesn't have an implementation and a subclass must provide this;
+ the two concrete classes, `ConcreteClass_1` and `ConcreteClass_2`, extends the abstract `BaseClass` and they provide a concrete implementation of the abstract `a_method()` method.
# 1. Creating an abstract base class
Imagine we are creating a Media Player with third-party plugins. We'll create an **Abstract Base Class** (**ABC**) to document what API the third-party plugins should provide. **Documentation** is one of the stronger use cases for ABCs.

The general design is to define the media player as an Abstraction (eventually with features that are common to all the concrete class we'll implement) and each unique kind of media format will provide a **concrete implementation** of the abstraction. The `abc` module allows us to do that:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class MediaLoader(ABC):
	@abstractmethod
    def play(self) -> None:
        pass

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def ext(self) -> None:
        pass
```
Using `@abstractmethod`, we are marking a method or a property as **Abstract**, so any subclass **must implement** that method or property in order to be a concrete implementation. Now the `MediaLoader` class has a new special attribute, `__abstractmethods__` that lists all the names that weed to be filled:
```
>>> MediaLoader.__abstractmethods__
frozenset({'ext', 'play'})
```
Let's see what happens if we try to instantiate a concrete implementation of the `MediaLoader` abstract class without giving a proper implementation of the methods or properties marked with `@abstracthmethod`:
```python
class Wav(MediaLoader):
	pass

x = Wav()
```
As expected, the output will be:
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[51], line 4
      1 class Wav(MediaLoader):
      2 	pass
----> 4 x = Wav()

TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Wav with abstract methods ext, play
```

Now, a proper concrete implementation of the superclass:
```python
class Ogg(MediaLoader):
    ext = '.ogg'
    def play(self):
        pass

o = Ogg()
```

One important use case for ABCs is the `collections` module. This module defines the built-in generic collections using a sophisticated set of base classes and mixins.
## 1.1. The ABCs of collections
`collections` module is a really comprehensive use of the abstract base classes in the Python standard library. Indeed the collections we commonly use are extensions of the `Collection` abstract class. Furthermore `Collection` is an extension of an even more fundamental abstraction, `Container`.

Since the foundation is the `Container` class, let's inspect what methods this class require:
```terminal
>>> from collections.abc import Container

>>> Container.__abstractmethods__
frozenset({'__contains__'})
```

To see the signature that this method has you can use the `help()` function:
```terminal
>>> help(Container.__contains__)
Help on function __contains__ in module collections.abc:

__contains__(self, x)
```
We can see that this method needs to take a single argument `x` and, even though there are no further explanations, we can guess that this argument is the value that the user wants to check whether it is hold by the container. This special method implements the Python `in` operator (`in` is a syntax sugar that delegates to the `__contains__()` method) and it's implemented by `set`, `list`, `str`, `tuple`, and `dict`. However we can define a new container and implement this method to check if a given value is an odd integer:
```python
class OddIntegers:
    def __contains__(self, value: int) -> bool:
        return value % 2 != 0
    
odd = OddIntegers()
```
The interesting part is that this class behaves as a `Container` object, even though we didn't extend from it:
```terminal
>>> isinstance(odd, Container)
True

>>> issubclass(OddIntegers, Container)
True
```
That's way **duck typing** is way more awesome than classical polymorphism ("if `odd` behaves like a `Container`, then it's a `Container`"). We can create is-a relationship without of writing the code to set up inheritance.

One thing to notice about the `Container` ABC is that any class that extends it gets to use the `in` keyword for free:
>[!tip] 
> Any class that has a `__contains__()` method is a `Container` and can therefore be queries by the `in` keyword.
> 
> A quote from *Fluent Python* book by *Luciano Ramalho* (pg. 402): "[\...] we saw that you donâ€™t need to inherit from any special class to create a fully functional sequence type in Python; you just need to implement the methods that fulfill the sequence protocol."

```terminal
>>> odd = OddIntegers()
>>> 1 in odd
True
>>> 2 in odd
False
>>> 3 in odd
True
```
The real value here is the possibility to create new kinds of collections that are completely compatible with Python's built-in generic collections. For example, we could create a dictionary that uses a binary tree structure to retain keys instead of a hashed lookup (more details about [how python dictionary are implemented here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/327311/how-are-pythons-built-in-dictionaries-implemented)) by starting from `Mapping` abstract base class and by properly define methods like `__getitem__()`, `__setitem__()`, `__delitem__()`. 

Python's Duck Typing works (in part) via the `isinstance()` and `issubclass()` built-in functions. They're used to determine class relationships and they rely on two internal methods that classes can provide: `__instancecheck__()` and `__subclasscheck__()`.
## 1.2. Abstract base classes and type hints
*todo*
## 1.3. The collections.abc module
Abstract base classes are widely used in the `collections.abc` module. This module provides the abstract base class definitions for Python's build-int collections and that's how `list`, `set`, and `dict` (etc.) can be built from individual component definitions. Indeed, this module doesn't contain definitions for `list`, `set`, or `dict`, but it contains definitions like `MutableSequence`, `MutableMapping`, and `MutableSet`, which are abstract base classes for which the `list`, `set`, and `dict` are the concrete implementations.

Let's see graphically how Python `dict` class is implemented:
![](Technical%20Books/Python%20Object-Oriented%20Programming/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240912232439.png)

+ `dict` class is a concrete implementation of `MutableMapping` class;
+ the `MutableMapping` class depends on the `Mapping` class, an immutable, frozen dictionary (indeed it doesn't have `__setitem__()` and `__delitem__()` methods).
+ the `Mapping` class depends on three other abstract base classes: `Container`, `Iterable`, and `Sized`.

If we want to create a **lookup-only dictionary** - a concrete `Mapping` implementation - we'll need to implement at least the following methods:
+ The `Sized` abstraction requires an implementation for the `__len__()` method; this lets an instance of our class respond to the `len()` function.
+ The `Iterable` abstraction requires an implementation for the `__iter__()` method; this lets an object work with the `for` statement and the `iter()` function.
+ The `Container` abstraction requires an implementation for the `__contains__()` method; this permits the `in` and `not in` operators to work.
+ The `Collection` abstraction combines `Sized`, `Iterable`, and `Container` without introducing additional abstract methods.
+ The `Mapping` abstraction, requires, among other things, `__getitem__()`, `__iter__()`, and `__len__()`.

By building this new dictionary-like immutable class from these abstractions, we can be sure that our class will collaborate seamlessly with other Python generic classes.
### Example: Lookup class
Let's define an immutable `Mapping` object implementation by extending the abstract classes. The goal is:
1. to be able to create a dictionary-like mapping with keys and values;
2. then extract a value from its corresponding key.

The goal is to create a `Lookup` class with the following type hint:
```python
abc.Mapping[Comparable, Any]
```
so, we want to create a dictionary-like mapping from some key (with the type `Comparable` because we want to be able to compare the keys and sort them into order because searching through an ordered list is often more efficient) to an object of any possible type (`Any`). Note that the `dict` built-in class has the following type hint `MutableMapping[_KT, _VT]`.

A Python dictionary can be built from two different kinds of data structures and we want this flexibility in our new mapping class:
+ from an existing mapping (1)
+ from a sequence of two-tuples with keys and values (2)
```python
x = dict({"a": 42, "b": 7, "c": 6}) # (1)
y = dict([("a", 42), ("b", 7), ("c", 6)]) # (2)

x == y # Output: True
```

This means that we need two separate definitions for `__init__()` that represent two alternatives to create an instance of our new `Lookup` class:
1. `def __init__(self, source: Mapping[Comparable, Any]) -> None`
2. `def __init__(self, source: Iterable[tuple[Comparable, Any]]) -> None`

We'll provide two methods definitions with these two alternatives (we'll use the `@overload` decorator) and then the real method definition with the actual logic.
>[!note]- `@overload` clarifications
>Note that the `@overload` decorator does **not actually implement the function** logic for each signature. Instead, it is used for **type hinting** and **static type checking** by tools like `mypy`. The actual implementation of the method is written separately and typically matches one of the signatures.

Let's implement both `Lookup` and `Comparable` classes :
```python
from collections.abc import Mapping, Iterable, Iterator
from typing import Any, overload, Union, Sequence
from __future__ import annotations
import bisect
from typing import Protocol


class Comparable(Protocol):
    def __eq__(self, other: Any) -> bool: ...
    def __ne__(self, other: Any) -> bool: ...
    def __le__(self, other: Any) -> bool: ...
    def __lt__(self, other: Any) -> bool: ...
    def __ge__(self, other: Any) -> bool: ...
    def __gt__(self, other: Any) -> bool: ...


class Lookup(Mapping[Comparable, Any]):
    @overload
    def __init__(self, source: Iterable[tuple[Comparable, Any]]) -> None:
        ...

    @overload
    def __init__(self, source: Mapping[Comparable, Any]) -> None:
        ...

    def __init__(self, source: Union[Iterable[tuple[Comparable, Any]], Mapping[Comparable, Any], None] = None) -> None:
        sorted_pairs: Sequence[tuple[Comparable, Any]]
        if isinstance(source, Sequence):
            print("The source is of Sequence type")
            sorted_pairs = sorted(source)
        elif isinstance(source, Mapping):
            print("The source is of Mapping type")
            sorted_pairs = sorted(source.items())
        else:
            sorted_pairs = []
        self.key_list = [p[0] for p in sorted_pairs]
        self.value_list = [p[1] for p in sorted_pairs]

        
    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return len(self.key_list)
    
    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[Comparable]:
        return iter(self.key_list)
    
    def __contains__(self, key: object) -> bool:
        index = bisect.bisect_left(self.key_list, key)
        return key == self.key_list[index]
    
    def __getitem__(self, key: Comparable) -> Any:
        index = bisect.bisect_left(self.key_list, key)
        if key == self.key_list[index]:
            return self.value_list[index]
        raise KeyError(key)
```
Now we'll create two instances of the `Lookup` class first using a `Sequence` as input and then a `Mapping`:
```python
sequence_source = Lookup(
    [
        ["z","Zillah"],
        ["a", "Amy"],
        ["c", "Clara"],
        ["b", "Basil"]
    ]
)

mapping_source = Lookup(
    {
        "z": "Zillah",
        "a": "Amy",
        "c": "Clara",
        "b": "Basil"
    }
)
```
(*PS: some type hints in the Lookup class are not completely clear to me. I.E. why using Iterable in the \__init__ and then Sequence in the if-else statement?*)
Then:
```
>>> print(sequence_source["c"])
The source is of Sequence type
Clara

>>> print(mapping_source["c"])
The source is of Mapping type
Clara

>>> x["m"] = "Maud"
TypeError: 'Lookup' object does not support item assignment
```
+ The `__init__()` handles 3 cases for loading a mapping:
	1. building the values from a sequence of pairs
	2. building the values from a mapping object
	3. creating an empty sequence of values;
+ we provide concretes implementations of:
	+ `__len__()`, `__iter__()`, `__contains__()`, required by the `Sized`, `Iterable`, and `Container` abstract classes. Then the `Collection` class combines all together
	+ `__getitem__()`, required by `Mapping` abstract class
	+ Note that the `__contains__()` definition has the `object` type as the type hint because Python's `in` operations needs to support any kind of object, even ones that don't obviously support the `Comparable` protocol;
+ this class doesn't support item assignment because we didn't define `__setitem__()` method;
+ the `Comparable` class defines the minimum set of features - the **protocol** - for the keys of the object used to instantiate the `Lookup`class. It's a way to formalize the comparison rules required to keep the keys for the mapping in order. There is no implementation of such methods because it us used to introduce a new type hint. We provide `...` as the bodies because the bodies will be provided by existing class definitions like `str` and `int`.

The general approach to using abstract classes is:
1. find the class that does most of what you need;
2. identify the methods in the `collections.abc` definitions that are marked as `abstract`;
3. subclass the abstract class, filling in the missing methods.
## 1.4. Creating your own abstract base class
There are two general paths to create classes that are similar:
1. duck typing: offers the most flexibility, but it may sacrifice the ability yo use *mypy*;
2. define common abstractions: can be wordy and confusing.

Let's handle a problem: we can to build a simulation of games that involve polyhedral dice. A problem to solve is how to best simulate rolls of these different shaped dice; Python offers three way to get random data:
1. the `random` module
2. the `os` module
3. the `secrets` module

Rather than bake the choice of random number generator into a class, we can define an abstract class that has the general features of a die and concrete subclasses can supply the missing randomization capability.

Let's use the `abc` module that has the foundational definitions for abstract classes (note that the `abc` module is distinct from the `collections.abc` module):
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Die(ABC):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.face: int
        self.roll()

    @abstractmethod
    def roll(self) -> None:
        pass

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"{self.face}"
```
This class inherits from the `abc.ABC` class that assures us that any attempt to create an instance of the `Die` class directly will raise a `TypeError` exception:
```terminal
>>> d = Die()
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Die with abstract method roll
```

Let's extend this abstract class with two subclasses using two different approaches to select a random value:
```python
import random

class D4(Die):
    def roll(self) -> None:
        self.face = random.choice((1, 2, 3, 4))

class D6(Die):
    def roll(self) -> None:
        self.face = random.randint(1,6)
```

Now, let's create another abstract class that represents a **handful of dice**. In some games, the rules require the player to roll all the dice, some two dice, some at most two dice. So, there are different rules that apply to a simple list of `Die` instances. Here's a class that leaves the roll implementation as an abstraction:
```python
from typing import Type

class Dice(ABC):
    def __init__(self, n: int, die_class: Type[Die]) -> None:
        self.dice = [die_class() for _ in range(n)]

    @abstractmethod
    def roll(self) -> None:
        pass

    @property
    def total(self) -> int:
        return sum(d.face for d in self.dice)
```
+ `n` is an integer representing how many dice are needed;
+ the type hint `Type[Die]` means that any subclass of the abstract base class `Die` is accepted. `die_class` is expected to be a **class object** (like `Die` or one of its subclasses, like `D4` and `D6`), not an instance of that class.

Now we'll extend the `Dice` class with a subclass that implements the roll-all-the-dice rule:
```python
class SimpleDice(Dice):
    def roll(self) -> None:
        for d in self.dice:
            d.roll()
```
Now we'll create an instance of this class using 6 instances of `D6` and we'll calculate the sum of the faces after rolling this handful of 6 dice:
```python
sd = SimpleDice(6, D6)
sd.roll()
sd.total # Output: 30 - each time you got a different number of course
```


Let's extend the `Dice` class with another implementation:
```python
from collections.abc import Set


class YachtDice(Dice):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__(5, D6)
        self.saved: Set[int] = set()

    def saving(self, positions: Iterable[int]) -> YachtDice:
        if not all(0 <= n < 6 for n in positions):
            raise ValueError("Invalid position")
        self.saved = set(positions)
        return self

    def roll(self) -> None:
        for i, d in enumerate(self.dice):
            if i not in self.saved:
                d.roll()
        self.saved = set()
```
Let's see how this works:
```terminal
>>> sd = YachtDice()

>>> sd.roll()
>>> sd.dice
[3, 3, 1, 4, 2]

>>> sd.saving([0, 1, 2]).roll()
>>> sd.dice
[3, 3, 1, 3, 4]
```
In this example, we saved the dice in positions `0`, `1`, and `2`. When rolling the dice a second time, the first three dice remain unchanged, and only the last two are rolled.
