`dict` type is a fundamental part of Python's implementation. Many constructs in Python are represented by dictionaries in memory. Due to their importance, Python **dictionaries** are **highly optimized** and **Hash Tables** are the **engines behind Python's high performance dictionaries**.

Other built-in types based on hash tables are `set` and `frozenset` that have a richer APIs compared to sets in other programming languages.
# 1. Modern `dict` syntax
## 1.1. dict Comprehensions
A **dictcomp** (dict comprehension) builds a `dict` instance by taking `key:value` pairs from ant iterable and the syntax derives from listcomps and genexps.

Let's make a simple example:
```python
dial_codes = [
    (880, 'Bangladesh'),
    (55, 'Brazil'),
    (86, 'China'),
    (62, 'Indonesia')
]

country_dial = {country: code for (code, country) in dial_codes}
ountry_dial_2 = {code: country.upper() for country, code in sorted(country_dial.items()) if code < 70}
```
Then:
```terminal
>>> country_dial
{'Bangladesh': 880, 'Brazil': 55, 'China': 86, 'Indonesia': 62}

>>> country_dial_2
{55: 'BRAZIL', 62: 'INDONESIA'}
```

Note that we could pass the iterable `dial_codes` directly to the `dict()` constructor, but with the dict comprehension we swapped the `country` and the `code`.
## 1.2. Unpacking Mappings
PEP 448 enhanced the support of mapping unpackings in two ways:
1. we can apply `**` to more than one argument in a function call; this works if the keys are all strings and unique across all arguments (because duplicate keyword arguments are fobidden):

	```terminal
	>>> def dumps(**kwargs):
	...    return kwargs
	
	>>> dumps(**{'x': 3, 'y': 10}, z='4', **{'s': 15})
	{'x': 3, 'y': 10, 'z': '4', 's': 15}

	>>> dumps(**{'x': 3, 'y': 10}, z='4', **{'x': 15})
	TypeError: __main__.dumps() got multiple values for keyword argument 'x'
	```

2. `**` can be used inside a `dict` literal (in this case duplicates are allowed and later occurrences overwrite previous ones):

	```terminal	
	>>> {**{'x': 3, 'y': 10}, 'z': '4', **{'s': 15}}
	{'x': 15, 'y': 10, 'z': '4'}
	```
## 1.3. Merging Mappings with `|`
Python 3.9 supports `|` and `|=` to merge mappings.

The `|` operator creates a new mapping:
```terminal
>>> d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
>>> d2 = {'x': 10, 'a': 20}

>>> d1 | d2
{'a': 20, 'b': 2, 'x': 10}
```

The `|=` operator updates an existing mapping in-place:
```terminal
>>> d1
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}

>>> d1 |= d2
>>> d1
{'a': 20, 'b': 2, 'x': 10} 
```
# 3. Standard API for Mapping Types
The `collections.abc` module provides the `Mapping` and `MutableMapping` abstract class describing the interfaces of `dict` and similar types:
![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241009221529.png)
```terminal
>>> from collections.abc import Mapping, MutableMapping

>>> my_dict = {}
>>> isinstance(my_dict, Mapping)
True

>>> isinstance(my_dict, MutableMapping)
True
```

Note that using `isinstance` with an abstract class is often better then checking whether a function argument is of the concrete `dict` type, because then alternative mapping types can be used (Chapter 13 *TODO TOUNDERSTAND*).

To implement a custom mapping, it's easier to extend the concrete class `collections.UserDict` from the standard library, instead of subclassing those abstract class. That's because it encaspulate the basic `dict` in its implementation, which in turn is built on hash table. The limitation is that the key must be hashable.
## 3.1. What is Hashable
This is the definition of **Hashable** adopted by the [Python Glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable):
> [!cite]
> An object is **hashable** if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a `__hash__()` method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an `__eq__()` method). Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value.
> \[...] and their hash value is derived from their `id()`.

Some info:
+ numeric type, `str`, and `bytes` are all hashable;
+ container types are hashable is they are immutabl and all contained objects are also hashable;
+ a `frozen` set is always hashable, because every element contained must be hashable by definition;
+ a `tuple` is hashable only if all its elements are hashable;
+ user-defined types are hashable by default (*WHY? TODO on the book*).
```terminal
>>> tt = (1, 2, (30, 40))
>>> hash()
-3907003130834322577


>>> tl = (1, 2, [30, 40])
>>> hash(tl)
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'

>>> tf = (1, 2, frozenset([30, 40]))
>>> hash(tf)
5149391500123939311
```
## 3.2. Overview of Common Mapping Methods
Let's see the methods implemented by `dict` and two popular variations: `defaultdict` and `OrderedDict`, both defined in the `collections` module:
![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241017220829.png)![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241017221008.png)

The way `d.update(m)` handles the argument `m` is a proper example of **duck typing**: if first checks whether `m` has a `keys()` method and, if it does, assumes it is a mapping. Otherwise, `update()` falls back to iterating over `m`, assuming its items are `(key, value)` pairs. Let's see the most common cases:
+ `m` is a mapping type:
```terminal
>>> d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
>>> d2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
>>> d1.update(d2)
>>> d1
{'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```
* `m` is a list of tuples:
```terminal
>>> d = {'a': 1}
>>> list_of_tuples = [('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
>>> d.update(list_of_tuples)
>>> d
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```
* `m` is a tuple of tuples:
```terminal
>>> d = {'a': 1}
>>> tuple_of_tuples = (('b', 2), ('c', 3))
>>> d.update(tuple_of_tuples)
>>> d
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

Note that the constructor for most Python mapping uses the same logic of `update()` internally, which means they can be initialized from other mappings or from any iterable object producing `(key, value)` pairs:
```terminal
>>> list_of_tuples = [('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
>>> dict_from_list_of_tuples = dict(list_of_tuples)
>>> dict_from_list_of_tuples
{'b': 2, 'c': 3}

>>> tuple_of_tuples = (('b', 2), ('c', 3))
>>> dict_from_tuple_of_tuples = dict(tuple_of_tuples)
>>> dict_from_tuple_of_tuples
{'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```
## 3.3. Inserting or Updating Mutable Values
In a dictionary, if you access `d[k]` when `k` is not an existing key, it raises a `KeyError` exception. An alternative to set a default value is `d.get(k, default_value)` that allows us not to deal with a `KeyError`.

However, there's a better way to go when you want to **retrieve a mutable value and want to update it**, that is by using `setdefault()` method of mapping types. By definition `d.setdefault(k, [default])` does the following: if `k` in `d`, return `d[k]`, else set `d[k] = default` and return it.

Say we want to create a script to index text, meaning that I want a mapping where:
+ each key is a word
+ the value is a list of positions where that word occurs (line_number, column_number)

Basically, the output must be like:
```terminal
a [(19, 48), (20, 53)]
and [(15, 23)]
are [(21, 12)]
```

Let's write a first version of this script using `dict.get()` and we'll show that it's not the best solution:
```python {13,14,15}
import re

WORD_RE = re.compile(r'\w+')

index = {}
with open("find_word_test.txt", encoding='utf-8') as fp:
    for line_no, line in enumerate(fp, 1):
        for match in WORD_RE.finditer(line):
            word = match.group()
            column_no = match.start() + 1
            location = (line_no, column_no)

            occurrences = index.get(word, [])
            occurrences.append(location)
            index[word] = occurrences

for word in sorted(index, key=str.upper):
    print(word, index[word])
```
+ *Line 13*: get the list of occurrences for `word` or `[]` if not found;
+ *Line 14*: append new location to `occurrences`;
+ *Line 15*: put changed `occurrences` into `index` dict.

Note that you cannot say: `occurrences = index.get(word, []).append(location)` due to the Python convention to return a `NoneType` when an in-place function is run, as we already said in [8.1. `list.sort()` chapter](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/02.%20An%20Array%20of%20Sequences.md#8.1.%20`list.sort()`).

These three lines, though, can be replaced by a single line using `dict.setdefault`:
```python {13}
import re

WORD_RE = re.compile(r'\w+')

index = {}
with open("find_word_test.txt", encoding='utf-8') as fp:
    for line_no, line in enumerate(fp, 1):
        for match in WORD_RE.finditer(line):
            word = match.group()
            column_no = match.start() + 1
            location = (line_no, column_no)

            index.setdefault(word, []).append(location)

for word in sorted(index, key=str.upper):
    print(word, index[word])
```
+ *Line 13*: get the list of occurrences for `word` or set it to `[]` if not found; `setdefault` returns the value, so it can be updated.

In other words, the following code with `setdefault()` function:
```python
key = "key1"
new_value = "new_value"

my_dict.setdefault(key, []).append(new_value)
```
is the same as returning:
```python
key = "key1"
new_value = "new_value"

if key not in my_dict:
	my_dict[key] = []
my_dict[key].append(new_value)
```
# 4. Automatic handling of Missing Keys
There are two main approaches to deal with mapping types that don't have the key we are looking for:
+ using the `defaultdict` container from `collections` module;
+ subclassing `dict` or any other mapping type and add `__missing__` method.
## 4.1. `defaultdict`: another take on Missing Keys
A `defaultdict` in Python is a specialized subclass of the built-in `dict`, where a default value is automatically assigned to a key that doesn't exist in the dictionary. When instantiating a `defaultdict`, you provide a callable to produce a default value whenever `__getitem__` is passed a nonexistent key argument.

Let's give a first example:
```terminal
>>> from collections import defaultdict

>>> count = defaultdict(int)
>>> count['apple'] += 1

>>> count
defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'apple': 1})
```
+ `defaultdict` with `int` as default factory (`0` for missing keys);
+ If `apple` doesn't exist, it's initialized to `0`, then incremented.

Let's give another example:
```terminal
>>> grouped_words = defaultdict(list)
>>> grouped_words['fruits'].append('apple')

>>> grouped_words
defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'fruits': ['apple']})
```
+ `defaultdict` with `list` as default factory;
+ `fruits` key automatically gets an empty list, then `apple` is added.

With `defaultdict` class we can update the script we created [in the previous chapter](#3.3.%20Inserting%20or%20Updating%20Mutable%20Values):
```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

WORD_RE = re.compile(r'\w+')

index = defaultdict(list)
with open("find_word_test.txt", encoding='utf-8') as fp:
    for line_no, line in enumerate(fp, 1):
        for match in WORD_RE.finditer(line):
            word = match.group()
            column_no = match.start() + 1
            location = (line_no, column_no)

            index[word].append(location)

for word in sorted(index, key=str.upper):
    print(word, index[word])
```
## 4.2. The `__missing__` method
As mentioned above, `__missing__` method is a way mappings deal with missing keys. This method is not defined in the base `dict` class, but, if you subclass `dict` and provide a `__missing__` method, the standard `dict.__getitem__` will call it whenever a key is not found, instead of raising a `KeyError`.

Suppose we want a mapping (an instance of a class that we call `PowerfulDictionary`, which we'll define in a moment) where keys are converted to `str` when looked up; basically I want a mapping that I can lookup either with a `str` key and the corresponding `int`:
```terminal
>>> d = PowerfulDictionary([("2", "two"), ("4", "four")])

>>> d["2"]
'two'

>>> d[4]
'four'

>>> d.get("2")
'two'

>>> d.get(4)
'four'

>>> d.get(1, 'N/A')
'N/A'

>>> 2 in d
True

>>> 1 in d
False
```

So, let's create this new class `PowerfulDictionary` and a new instance of this class:
```python
class PowerfulDictionary(dict):
    def __missing__(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, str):
            raise KeyError(key)
        return self[str(key)]
    
    def get(self, key, default=None):
        try:
            return self[key]
        except KeyError:
            return default
        
    def __contains__(self, key):
        return key in self.keys() or str(key) in self.keys()

d = PowerfulDictionary([("2", "two"), ("4", "four")])
```
* *Line 1*: this class inherits from `dict`.
* *Line 3*: check whether `key` is already a `str`.
* *Line 5*: build `str` from `key` and look it up.
* *Line 9*: without this custom `get`, if you use `get` on a key that’s not in the dictionary, Python would fall back to the standard `dict.get` behavior, which **does not trigger the `__missing__` method.** Here’s the difference:
	* Without the custom `get`:
		```python
		d = PowerfulDictionary([("2", "two"), ("4", "four")])
		
		# Using get on a missing key
		print(d.get(2))  # Output: None
		# `__missing__` is not called because `dict.get` bypasses `__getitem__` and `__missing__`.
		```
	+ With the Custom `get`:
		```python
		d = PowerfulDictionary([("2", "two"), ("4", "four")])

		# Using get on a missing key
		print(d.get(2))  # Output: "two"
		# Custom `get` ensures that the `__getitem__` logic (and thus `__missing__`) is used.
		```
+ *Line 11*: if a `KeyError` was raised, `__missing__` already failed, so we return the `default`.
+ *Line 14*: search for unmodified key (the instance may contain non-`str` keys), then for a `str` built from the key.

Let's explain why the test `isinstance(key, str)` is necessary in the `__missing__` implementation. Without the `isinstance(key, str)` check, consider what happens when a non-string key that cannot be converted to an existing key is accessed:
1. `__getitem__` is called when `self[key]` is used.
2. If `key` isn't found, Python calls `__missing__(key)`.
3. In `__missing__`, `self[str(key)]` is evaluated.
4. This triggers `__getitem__` with `str(key)` as the key.
5. If `str(key)` isn't found, Python calls `__missing__` again with `str(key)`.
6. This loop continues forever, causing infinite recursion.

The line `if isinstance(key, str): raise KeyError(key)` ensures that once a string key is missing, recursion stops. Here's why:
- If `key` is already a string and not found, raising `KeyError` prevents `__missing__` from being called again with `str(key)`.
- If `key` is not a string, the code tries `self[str(key)]`.
- If `str(key)` still doesn't exist, `__missing__` is triggered again, but now `key` is a string, so `KeyError` is raised, stopping the recursion.
# 5. Variations of `dict`
Besides `defaultdict` that we already covered, there are other **mapping types** in the standard library.
## 5.1. `collections.OrderedDict`
Since Python 3.6 the built-in `dict` mapping keeps the keys ordered. This means that if you iterate over a dictionary or convert it to a list of keys (e.g., `list(d.keys())`), the order will match the order in which the keys were added. Because of that, the most common reason to use `OrderedDict` is writing code that is backward compatible with earlier Python versions.

Actually, there are other differences between `dict` and `OrderedDict`, so check on the web if you want to find out them.
## 5.2. `collections.ChainMap`
A `ChainMap` instance holds a **list of mappings** that can be **searched as one**. The lookup is performed on each input mapping **in the order it appears** in the constructor call, and succeeds as soon as the key is found in one of those mappings. The `ChainMap` instance does not copy the input mappings, but holds **references** to them. For example:
```python
from collections import ChainMap

d1 = dict(a=1, b=3)
d2 = dict(a=2, b=4, c=6)

chain = ChainMap(d1, d2)

print(chain['a']) # Output: 1
print(chain['c']) # Output: 6
```

Updates and insertions to a `ChainMap` only affect the first input mapping:
```terminal
>>> chain['c'] = -1
>>> d1
{'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': -1}

>>> d2
{'a': 2, 'b': 4, 'c': 6}
```
## 5.3. `collections.Counter`
A `Counter` instance holds an **integer count for each key**. This is used to count instances of hashable objects. One of the most common method is `most_common([n])`, which returns an ordered list of tuples wit the n most common items and their counts (if there are some objects with the same count value, they appear in order). For example:
```terminal
>>> from collections import Counter

>>> ct = Counter("abracadabra")
>>> ct
Counter({'a': 5, 'b': 2, 'r': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 1})

>>> ct.update("aaaaazzz")
>>> ct
Counter({'a': 10, 'z': 3, 'b': 2, 'r': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 1})

ct.most_common(3)
[('a', 10), ('z', 3), ('b', 2)]
```
## 5.5. Subclassing `UserDict` instead of `dict`
If you want to create a new mapping type, it's better to do it by extending `collections.UserDict` rather than `dict`. The main reason why it's better is that `dict` has some implementation shortcuts that end up forcing us to override methods that we can just inherit from `UserDict` with no problems (*more details in a paragraph of chapter 14 "Subclassing Built-in Types is tricky" \[TODO: add link when it's ready]*).

Note that `UserDict` does not inherit from `dict`, but it uses composition.

Now let's built a new version of `PowerfulDictionary` that we build earlier by extending from  `UserDict` rather than `dict`:
+ it will be more concise
+ it stores all keys as `str`
```python
from collections import UserDict

class PowerfulDictionary_2(UserDict):
    def __missing__(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, str):
            raise KeyError(key)
        return self[str(key)]
        
    def __contains__(self, key):
        return str(key) in self.data
    
    def __setitem__(self, key, item):
        self.data[str(key)] = item

ud = PowerfulDictionary_2([("2", "two"), ("4", "four")]) # {'2': 'two', '4': 'four'}
```
# 7. Dictionary views
The `dict` instance methods `.keys()`, `.values()`, and `.items()` return instances of classes called `dict_keys`, `dict_values`, and `dict_items`, respectively. These are called **dictionary views** and they are read-only projections of internal data structures used in the `dict` implementation. They avoid memory overhead of the equivalent Python 2 methods that returned lists duplicating data already in the target `dict`.

Let's see some basic operations supported by all dictionary views:
```terminal
>>> d = dict(a=10, b=20, c=30)
>>> values = d.values()

>>> values
dict_values([10, 20, 30])

>>> len(values)
3

>>> list(values)
[10, 20, 30]

>>> reversed(values)
<dict_reversevalueiterator at 0x1064595d0>

>>> values[0]
TypeError: 'dict_values' object is not subscriptable
```
+ *Line 5*: the `repr` of aa view object shows its content.
+ *Line 7*: we can query the `len` of a view.
+ *Line 10*: views are iterable, so it's easy to create lists from them.
+ *Line 13*: views implement `__reversed__`, returning a custom iterator.
+ *Line 16*: we can't use `[]` to get individual items from a view.

A view object is a **dynamic view** (or a **dynamic proxy**) on the dictionary’s entries, which means that when the dictionary changes, the view reflects these changes:
```terminal
>>> d["z"] = 99

>>> values
dict_values([10, 20, 30, 99])
```

Some differences between these dictionary views:
+ `dict_values` is the simplest one because it implements only the `__len__`, `__iter__`, and `__reversed__` special methods.
+ `dict_keys` and `dict_items` implement the previous special methods and also several set methods that we'll see in one of the next paragraph "*Set Operations on dict Views*" \[TODO: add link].
# 8. Practical Consequences of How dict works
The hash table implementation of Python's `dict` is very efficient, but it's important to understand the practical effects of this design:
+ **keys** must be **hashable objects** (they must implement proper `__hash__` and `__eq__`methods as already explained in [[#3.1. What is Hashable]]);
+ **items access by key** is very **fast**;
+ **key ordering** is **preserved** as a side effect of a more compact memory layout for `dict` in CPython 3.6;
+ despite its new compact layouts, dicts inevitable have a significant memory overhead;
+ to save memory, avoid creating instance attributes outside of the `__init__` method.

*TODO: this practical effects are not clear if we don't know details of the dict layout. Maybe something is explained here: https://www.fluentpython.com/extra/internals-of-sets-and-dicts/*
# 9. Set Theory
**Set types** (we consider both `set` and its immutable sibling `frozenset` as **Sets**) first appeared as modules in the Python 2.3 standard library, and then they were promoted to built-ins in Python 2.6.

A **set** is a **collection of unique objects**. A basic use case is removing duplication:
```terminal
>>> l = ['spam', 'spam', 'eggs', 'spam', 'bacon', 'eggs']
>>> set(l)
{'bacon', 'eggs', 'spam'}

>>> list(set(l))
['eggs', 'bacon', 'spam']
```

If you want to remove duplicates and also preserve the order of the first occurrence of each item, you can use a plain `dict` to do it:
```terminal
>>> dict.fromkeys(l).keys()
dict_keys(['spam', 'eggs', 'bacon'])

>>> list(dict.fromkeys(l).keys())
['spam', 'eggs', 'bacon']
```

**Set elements** must be **hashable**:
+ the `set` type is not hashable, so you can't build a `set` with nested `set` instances;
+ the `frozenset` type is hashable, so you can build a `set` with nested `frozenset` instances.

In addition to enforcing uniqueness, the set types implement many set operations as **infix operators**:
+ `a | b` returns their union;
+ `a & b` returns the intersection;
+ `a - b` returns the difference;
+ `a ^ b` returns the symmetric difference.

For example, imagine you have a large set of email addresses (the `haystack`) and a smaller set of addresses (the `needles`) and you need to count how many `needles` occur in the `haystack`. You can simply use the `&` operator:
```terminal
>>> haystack = set(["email1", "email2", "email3", "email4"])
>>> needles = set(["email2", "email3"])

>>> len(haystack & needles)
2
```

The alternative would be much more verbose:
```python
found = 0
for n in haystack:
    if n in needles:
        found += 1

# found is 2
```

Note that this last example works for any iterable objects, while the previous sets objects. However, you can build sets on the fly:
```terminal
found = len(set(needles)) & set(haystack)

# another way:
found = len(set(needles).intersection(haystack))
```

A note on **performance**: Thanks to their underlying hash table implementation, lookups in sets are extremely fast, taking only 0.3 microseconds to search for an element. Here's a comparison between a `set` and a `list` for finding an element among 1,000,000 objects:
```python
import timeit
import random

# Generate a big list and a big set
size = 10**6
big_list = list(range(size))
big_set = set(big_list)

# Generate random elements to look up
elements_to_lookup = [random.randint(0, size-1) for _ in range(1000)]

# Define lookup functions
def list_lookup():
    return any(element in big_list for element in elements_to_lookup)

def set_lookup():
    return any(element in big_set for element in elements_to_lookup)

# Measure lookup time
list_lookup_time = timeit.timeit(list_lookup, number=10)
set_lookup_time = timeit.timeit(set_lookup, number=10)

print(f"List lookup time: {list_lookup_time:.6f} seconds")
print(f"Set lookup time: {set_lookup_time:.6f} seconds")
```
Output:
```
List lookup time: 0.010839 seconds
Set lookup time: 0.000003 seconds

## 9.1. Set Literals
+ The **syntax of `set` literals** looks exactly like the math notation, with the exception that there's no literal notation for the empty `set`, so we use `set()`:
	```terminal
	>>> s = {1}
	
	>>> type(s)
	<class 'set'>

	>>> s
	{1}

	>>> s.pop()
	1

	>>> s
	set()
	```
	
	Literal `set` syntax like `{1, 2, 3}` is both faster and more readable than calling the constructor `set([1, 2, 3])` because, to evaluate it, in the latter form Python has to look up the `set` name to fetch the constructor, then build a list, and finally pass it to the constructor. Here's the bytecode of both forms:
	```
	>>> import dis

	>>> dis.dis('{1}')
	1           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (1)
                2 BUILD_SET                1
                4 RETURN_VALUE
	
	>>> dis.dis('set([1])')
	1          0 LOAD_NAME                0 (set)
               2 LOAD_CONST               0 (1)
               4 BUILD_LIST               1
               6 CALL_FUNCTION            1
               8 RETURN_VALUE
	```

+ The **syntax of `frozenset` literals** is very simple:
	```terminal
	>>> frozenset(range(10))
	frozenset({0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9})
	```
## 9.2. Set Comprehensions
**Set Comprehensions** (or *setcomps*) were added in Python 2.7 and their usage is very similar to the other comprehensions-like structure:
```terminal
>>> from unicodedata import name
>>> {chr(i) for i in range(32, 256) if "SIGN" in name(chr(i), '')}
{'#', '$', '%', '+', '<', '=', '>', '¢', '£', '¤', '¥', '§', '©', '¬', '®', '°', '±', 'µ', '¶', '×', '÷'}
```
# 10. Practical Consequences of How Sets work
*TODO. as in the [[#8. Practical Consequences of How dict works]] maybe it's better to look at https://www.fluentpython.com/extra/internals-of-sets-and-dicts/ before and then try to read these chapters again.*
# 11. Set Operations on dict Views
The following table shows that the view objects `dict_keys` and `dict_values` are similar to `frozenset`:

In particular, `dict_keys`, and `dict_items` implement the special methods to support the powerful set operators `&`, `|`, `-`, and `^`. However, note that the return value will be a set:
```terminal
>>> d1 = dict(a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4)
>>> d2 = dict(b=20, d=40, e=50)

>>> d1.keys() & d2.keys()
{'b', 'd'}
```

Furthermore, the set operators in dictionary views are compatible with `set` instances:
```terminal
>>> s = {'a', 'e', 'i'}
>>> d1.keys() & s
{'a'}
```

Note that a `dict_items` view only works as a set if all values in the `dict` are hashable while `dict_keys` view can always be used as a set because every key is already hashable by definition.
