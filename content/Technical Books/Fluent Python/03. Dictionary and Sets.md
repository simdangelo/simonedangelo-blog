`dict` type is a fundamental part of Python's implementation. Many constructs in Python are represented by dictionaries in memory. Due to their importance, Python **dictionaries** are **highly optimized** and **Hash Tables** are the **engines behind Python's high performance dictionaries**.

Other built-in types based on hash tables are `set` and `frozenset` that have a richer APIs compared to sets in other programming languages.
# 1. Modern `dict` syntax
## 1.1. dict Comprehensions
A **dictcomp** (dict comprehension) builds a `dict` instance by taking `key:value` pairs from ant iterable and the syntax derives from listcomps and genexps.

Let's make a simple example:
```python
dial_codes = [
    (880, 'Bangladesh'),
    (55, 'Brazil'),
    (86, 'China'),
    (62, 'Indonesia')
]

country_dial = {country: code for (code, country) in dial_codes}
ountry_dial_2 = {code: country.upper() for country, code in sorted(country_dial.items()) if code < 70}
```
Then:
```terminal
>>> country_dial
{'Bangladesh': 880, 'Brazil': 55, 'China': 86, 'Indonesia': 62}

>>> country_dial_2
{55: 'BRAZIL', 62: 'INDONESIA'}
```

Note that we could pass the iterable `dial_codes` directly to the `dict()` constructor, but with the dict comprehension we swapped the `country` and the `code`.
## 1.2. Unpacking Mappings
PEP 448 enhanced the support of mapping unpackings in two ways:
1. we can apply `**` to more than one argument in a function call; this works if the keys are all strings and unique across all arguments (because duplicate keyword arguments are fobidden):

	```terminal
	>>> def dumps(**kwargs):
	...    return kwargs
	
	>>> dumps(**{'x': 3, 'y': 10}, z='4', **{'s': 15})
	{'x': 3, 'y': 10, 'z': '4', 's': 15}

	>>> dumps(**{'x': 3, 'y': 10}, z='4', **{'x': 15})
	TypeError: __main__.dumps() got multiple values for keyword argument 'x'
	```

2. `**` can be used inside a `dict` literal (in this case duplicates are allowed and later occurrences overwrite previous ones):

	```terminal	
	>>> {**{'x': 3, 'y': 10}, 'z': '4', **{'s': 15}}
	{'x': 15, 'y': 10, 'z': '4'}
	```
## 1.3. Merging Mappings with `|`
Python 3.9 supports `|` and `|=` to merge mappings.

The `|` operator creates a new mapping:
```terminal
>>> d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
>>> d2 = {'x': 10, 'a': 20}

>>> d1 | d2
{'a': 20, 'b': 2, 'x': 10}
```

The `|=` operator updates an existing mapping in-place:
```terminal
>>> d1
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}

>>> d1 |= d2
>>> d1
{'a': 20, 'b': 2, 'x': 10} 
```
# 2. Pattern Matching with Mappings (TODO)
*TODO*
# 3. Standard API for Mapping Types
The `collections.abc` module provides the `Mapping` and `MutableMapping` abstract class describing the interfaces of `dict` and similar types:
![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241009221529.png)
```terminal
>>> from collections.abc import Mapping, MutableMapping

>>> my_dict = {}
>>> isinstance(my_dict, Mapping)
True

>>> isinstance(my_dict, MutableMapping)
True
```

Note that using `isinstance` with an abstract class is often better then checking whether a function argument is of the concrete `dict` type, because then alternative mapping types can be used (Chapter 13 *TODO TOUNDERSTAND*).

To implement a custom mapping, it's easier to extend the concrete class `collections.UserDict` from the standard library, instead of subclassing those abstract class. That's because it encaspulate the basic `dict` in its implementation, which in turn is built on hash table. The limitation is that the key must be hashable.
## 3.1. What is Hashable
This is the definition of **Hashable** adopted by the [Python Glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable):
> [!cite]
> An object is **hashable** if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a `__hash__()` method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an `__eq__()` method). Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value.
> \[...] and their hash value is derived from their `id()`.

+ numeric type, `str`, and `bytes` are all hashable;
+ container types are hashable is they are immutabl and all contained objects are also hashable;
+ a `frozen` set is always hashable, because every element contained must be hashable by definition;
+ a `tuple` is hashable only if all its elements are hashable;
+ user-defined types are hashable by default (*WHY? TODO on the book*).
```terminal
>>> tt = (1, 2, (30, 40))
>>> hash()
-3907003130834322577


>>> tl = (1, 2, [30, 40])
>>> hash(tl)
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'

>>> tf = (1, 2, frozenset([30, 40]))
>>> hash(tf)
5149391500123939311
```
## 3.2. Overview of Common Mapping Methods
Let's see the methods implemented by `dict` and two popular variations: `defaultdict` and `OrderedDict`, both defined in the `collections` module:
![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241017220829.png)![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241017221008.png)

The way `d.update(m)` handles the argument `m` is a proper example of **duck typing**: if first checks whether `m` has a `keys()` method and, if it does, assumes it is a mapping. Otherwise, `update()` falls back to iterating over `m`, assuming its items are `(key, value)` pairs. Let's see the most common cases:
+ `m` is a mapping type:
```terminal
>>> d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
>>> d2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
>>> d1.update(d2)
>>> d1
{'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```
* `m` is a list of tuples:
```terminal
>>> d = {'a': 1}
>>> list_of_tuples = [('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
>>> d.update(list_of_tuples)
>>> d
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```
* `m` is a tuple of tuples:
```terminal
>>> d = {'a': 1}
>>> tuple_of_tuples = (('b', 2), ('c', 3))
>>> d.update(tuple_of_tuples)
>>> d
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

Note that the constructor for most Python mapping uses the same logic of `update()` internally, which means they can be initialized from other mappings or from any iterable object producing `(key, value)` pairs:
```terminal
>>> list_of_tuples = [('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
>>> dict_from_list_of_tuples = dict(list_of_tuples)
>>> dict_from_list_of_tuples
{'b': 2, 'c': 3}

>>> tuple_of_tuples = (('b', 2), ('c', 3))
>>> dict_from_tuple_of_tuples = dict(tuple_of_tuples)
>>> dict_from_tuple_of_tuples
{'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```
## 3.3. Inserting or Updating Mutable Values
In a dictionary, if you access `d[k]` when `k` is not an existing key, it raises a `KeyError` exception. An alternative to set a default value is `d.get(k, default_value)` that allows us not to deal with a `KeyError`.

However, there's a better way to go when you want to **retrieve a mutable value and want to update it**, that is by using `setdefault()` method of mapping types. By definition `d.setdefault(k, [default])` does the following: if `k` in `d`, return `d[k]`, else set `d[k] = default` and return it.

Say we want to create a script to index text, meaning that I want a mapping where:
+ each key is a word
+ the value is a list of positions where that word occurs (line_number, column_number)

Basically, the output must be like:
```terminal
a [(19, 48), (20, 53)]
and [(15, 23)]
are [(21, 12)]
```

Let's write a first version of this script using `dict.get()` and we'll show that it's not the best solution:
```python {13,14,15}
import re

WORD_RE = re.compile(r'\w+')

index = {}
with open("find_word_test.txt", encoding='utf-8') as fp:
    for line_no, line in enumerate(fp, 1):
        for match in WORD_RE.finditer(line):
            word = match.group()
            column_no = match.start() + 1
            location = (line_no, column_no)

            occurrences = index.get(word, [])
            occurrences.append(location)
            index[word] = occurrences

for word in sorted(index, key=str.upper):
    print(word, index[word])
```
+ *Line 13*: get the list of occurrences for `word` or `[]` if not found;
+ *Line 14*: append new location to `occurrences`;
+ *Line 15*: put changed `occurrences` into `index` dict.

Note that you cannot say: `occurrences = index.get(word, []).append(location)` due to the Python convention to return a `NoneType` when an in-place function is run, as we already said in [8.1. `list.sort()` chapter](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/02.%20An%20Array%20of%20Sequences.md#8.1.%20`list.sort()`).

These three lines, though, can be replaced by a single line using `dict.setdefault`:
```python {13}
import re

WORD_RE = re.compile(r'\w+')

index = {}
with open("find_word_test.txt", encoding='utf-8') as fp:
    for line_no, line in enumerate(fp, 1):
        for match in WORD_RE.finditer(line):
            word = match.group()
            column_no = match.start() + 1
            location = (line_no, column_no)

            index.setdefault(word, []).append(location)

for word in sorted(index, key=str.upper):
    print(word, index[word])
```
+ *Line 13*: get the list of occurrences for `word` or set it to `[]` if not found; `setdefault` returns the value, so it can be updated.

In other words, the following code with `setdefault()` function:
```python
key = "key1"
new_value = "new_value"

my_dict.setdefault(key, []).append(new_value)
```
is the same as returning:
```python
key = "key1"
new_value = "new_value"

if key not in my_dict:
	my_dict[key] = []
my_dict[key].append(new_value)
```
# 4. Automatic handling of Missing Keys
There are two main approaches to deal with mapping types that don't have the key we are looking for:
+ using the `defaultdict` container from `collections` module;
+ subclassing `dict` or any other mapping type and add `__missing__` method.
## 4.1. `defaultdict`: another take on Missing Keys
A `defaultdict` in Python is a specialized subclass of the built-in `dict`, where a default value is automatically assigned to a key that doesn't exist in the dictionary. When instantiating a `defaultdict`, you provide a callable to produce a default value whenever `__getitem__` is passed a nonexistent key argument.

Let's give a first example:
```terminal
>>> from collections import defaultdict

>>> count = defaultdict(int)
>>> count['apple'] += 1

>>> count
defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'apple': 1})
```
+ `defaultdict` with `int` as default factory (`0` for missing keys);
+ If `apple` doesn't exist, it's initialized to `0`, then incremented.

Let's give another example:
```terminal
>>> grouped_words = defaultdict(list)
>>> grouped_words['fruits'].append('apple')

>>> grouped_words
defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'fruits': ['apple']})
```
+ `defaultdict` with `list` as default factory;
+ `fruits` key automatically gets an empty list, then `apple` is added.

With `defaultdict` class we can update the script we created [in the previous chapter](#3.3.%20Inserting%20or%20Updating%20Mutable%20Values):
```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

WORD_RE = re.compile(r'\w+')

index = defaultdict(list)
with open("find_word_test.txt", encoding='utf-8') as fp:
    for line_no, line in enumerate(fp, 1):
        for match in WORD_RE.finditer(line):
            word = match.group()
            column_no = match.start() + 1
            location = (line_no, column_no)

            index[word].append(location)

for word in sorted(index, key=str.upper):
    print(word, index[word])
```
## 4.2. The `__missing__` method
As mentioned above, `__missing__` method is a way mappings deal with missing keys. This method is not defined in the base `dict` class, but, if you subclass `dict` and provide a `__missing__` method, the standard `dict.__getitem__` will call it whenever a key is not found, instead of raising a `KeyError`.

Suppose we want a mapping (an instance of a class that we call `PowerfulDictionary`, which we'll define in a moment) where keys are converted to `str` when looked up; basically I want a mapping that I can lookup either with a `str` key and the corresponding `int`:
```terminal
>>> d = PowerfulDictionary([("2", "two"), ("4", "four")])

>>> d["2"]
'two'

>>> d[4]
'four'

>>> d.get("2")
'two'

>>> d.get(4)
'four'

>>> d.get(1, 'N/A')
'N/A'

>>> 2 in d
True

>>> 1 in d
False
```

So, let's create this new class `PowerfulDictionary` and a new instance of this class:
```python
class PowerfulDictionary(dict):
    def __missing__(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, str):
            raise KeyError(key)
        return self[str(key)]
    
    def get(self, key, default=None):
        try:
            return self[key]
        except KeyError:
            return default
        
    def __contains__(self, key):
        return key in self.keys() or str(key) in self.keys()

d = PowerfulDictionary([("2", "two"), ("4", "four")])
```
