# What we'll see
* By implementing **Special Methods**, your objects can behave like the built-in types, enabling the expressive coding style the community considers Pythonic.

# Python Data Model
> [!summary] Data Model
> **Data Model**: description of Python as a framework. It formalizes the interfaces of the building blocks of the language itself, such as sequences, functions, iterators, classes, and so on.
Python Data Model allows to write `len(collection)` instead of `collection.len()`. This apparent oddity is the tip of the entire Python Data Model and it's the key to everything we call **Pythonic**.

To create new classes, we leverage the Python Data Model and the Python Interpreter invokes **Special Methods** to perform basic object operations, often triggered by special syntax. The special method names are always written with leading and trailing double underscores. For example, in order to evaluate `my_collection[key]`, the interpreter calls `my_collection.__getitem__(key)`. We implement special methods when we want out objects to support and interact with fundamental language constructs.
Special methods are also called **Magic Methods** or **Dunder Methods** ("dunder" is a shortcut for double underscore before and after).
## Example about what "Pythonic" means
Le't show the power of implementing `__getitem__` and `__len__` inside a class:
```python
import collections

Card = collections.namedtuple("Card", ["rank", "suit"])

class FrenchDeck:
	ranks = [str(n) for n in range(2, 11)] + list("JQKA")
	suits = "spades diamonds clubs hearts".split()

	def __init__(self):
		self._cards = [Card(rank, suit) for suit in self.suits for rank in self.ranks]

	def __len__(self):
		return len(self._cards)

	def __getitem__(self, position):
		return self._cards[position]
```
Note that the reason of using `collections.namedtuple` is to provide a nice a representation for the cards in the deck:
```python
beer_card = Card('7', 'diamonds')
beer_card
```
Output:
```
Card(rank='7', suit='diamonds')
```

Let's instantiate a deck and see how many items it contains:
```python
deck = FrenchDeck()
len(deck)
```
Output:
```
52
```
Let's read a specific card from the deck:
```python
print(deck[0])
print(deck[-1])
```
Output:
```
Card(rank='2', suit='spades')
Card(rank='A', suit='hearts')
```
Furthermore, since `__getitem__` delegates to the `[]` operator, the deck automatically supports slicing and it makes it **iterable**:
```python
print(deck[:3])

for card in deck:
	print(card)
```
Output:
```
[Card(rank='2', suit='spades'), Card(rank='3', suit='spades'), Card(rank='4', suit='spades')]

Card(rank='2', suit='spades')
Card(rank='3', suit='spades')
Card(rank='4', suit='spades')
Card(rank='5', suit='spades')
...
```
To pick a random card from the deck we can use the Python built-in function `random.choice` to get a random number from a sequence:
```python
from random import choice

choice(deck)
```
Output:
```
Card(rank='10', suit='clubs')
```
Since with `__getitem__` dunder method, our class became an iterable, we can also use in **operator**:
```python
print(Card('Q', 'hearts') in deck)
print(Card('7', 'beast') in deck)
```
Output:
```
True
False
```
> [!info]- When an object is considered Iterable
> https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable>
 
You can also use the build-in `sorted()` function:
```python
suit_values = dict(spades=3, hearts=2, diamonds=1, clubs=0)

def spades_high(card):
	rank_value = FrenchDeck.ranks.index(card.rank)
	return rank_value * len(suit_values) + suit_values[card.suit]

for card in sorted(deck, key=spades_high):
print(card)
```
Output:
```
Card(rank='2', suit='clubs')
Card(rank='2', suit='diamonds')
Card(rank='2', suit='hearts')
Card(rank='2', suit='spades')
Card(rank='3', suit='clubs')
...
```
> [!summary] Recap
> Advantages of using Dunder Methods:
> * users of your classes **don't have to memorize arbitrary method names for standard operations** (`.size()` or `.lenght()` or what to get the number of items?)
> * it's easier to **benefit from the rich Python Standard Library** and avoid reinventing the wheel, like `random.choice`.
> * by implementing the special methods `__len__` and `__getitme__`, the `FrenchDeck` **behaves like a standard Python Sequence** with obvious advantages:
> 	* iteration, slicing from core language features
> 	* usage of `random.choice`, `reversed`, `sorted`

# How Special Methods are used
Dunder methods are meant to be called the the Python Interpreter, not by any users. You don't write `an_object.__len__`, but you write `len(an_object)` and, if `an_object` is an instance of a user-defined class, then Python calls the `__len__`method you implemented.

But the interpreter takes a shortcut when dealing for built-in types like `list`, `str`, `bytearray`, or extension like the NumPy array. Python variable-sized collections written in C include a struct called `PyVarObject`, which as an `ob_size` field holding the number of items in the collection. So, if `an_object` is an instance of one of those built-ins, then `len(an_object)` retrieves the value of the `ob_size` field, and this is much faster than calling a method.

Special method call is implicit. For example the statement `for i in x:` causes the invocation of `iter(x)`, which in turn calls `x.__iter__()` if it's available, or `x.__getitem__()` as it did in our example.

The only special method that is frequently called by user code directly is `__init__`.

It's always better to call built-in functions (e.g. `len`, `iter`, `str`, etc) instead of their corresponding special methods because they often provide other services and are faster than those method calls.

Now we'll see some of the most important uses of special methods:
* Emulating Numeric Types
* String representation of objects
* Boolean value of an object
* Implementing collections
## Emulating Numeric Types
Let' represent two-dimentional vectors and how to implement math operators:
```python
import math

class Vector:
	def __init__(self, x=0, y=0) -> None:
		self.x = x
		self.y = y

	def __repr__(self) -> str:
		return f"Vector({self.x!r}, {self.y!r})"

	def __abs__(self):
		return math.hypot(self.x, self.y)

	def __bool__(self):
		return bool(abs(self))

	def __add__(self, other):
		x = self.x + other.x
		y = self.y + other.y
		return Vector(x, y)

	def __mul__(self, scalar):
		return Vector(self.x*scalar, self.y*scalar)


v1 = Vector(2,4)
v2 = Vector(2,1)

print("__abs__ usage: ", abs(v1))
print("__add__ usage: ", v1+v2)
print("__mul__ usage: ", v1*3)
```
* `__abs__` special method is called by `abs` built-in;
* `__add__` special method is called by `+` built-in;
* `__mul__` special method is called by `*` built-in.
Output:
```
__abs__ usage: 4.47213595499958
__add__ usage: Vector(4, 5)
__mul__ usage: Vector(6, 12)
```
## String Representation
The`__repr__` special method is called by `repr` built-in to get the string representation of the object for inspection.
`print(v1)` without `__repr__`:
```
<__main__.Vector object at 0x10881a770>
```
`print(v1)` with `__repr__` defined as in the code above:
```
Vector(2, 4)
```
The string returned by `__repr__` should be unambiguous and, if possible, match the source code necessary to recreate the represented object.
In contrast `__str__` is called by the `str()` built-in and implicitly used by the `print` function.
Sometimes string returned by `__repr__` is user friendly, so you don't need to code `__str__`.
If you only implement one of the two special methods, choose `__repr__`.
## Boolean Value of a Custom Type
To determine whether a value `x` is *truthy* or *falsy*, Python applies `bool(x)`, which returns either ´True´ or `False`.
**`bool(x)`** calls **`x.__bool__`** special method. By default, instances of user-defined classes called in `bool()` function are returned as `True` unless `__bool__` or `__len__` methods are implemented. If `__bool__` is not implemented, Python tries to invoke `x.__len__`, and, if that returns zero, it `bool(x)` returns False; otherwise it returns `True`.
In our implementation, `__bool__`returns `False` if the magnitude of the vector is zero.
```python
v1 = Vector(2,4)
v2 = Vector(0,0)
aList = [1,2,3]

print(bool(v1))
print(bool(v2))
print(bool(aList))
```
Output:
```
True
False
True
```
## Collection API
The following is the interfaces of the essential collection types in Python. All these classes are ABCs - *abstract base classes*.
Method names in italic are abstract; the remaining have concrete implementations.
![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240612232007.png)The **`Collection`** abstract class in the figure unifies the three essential interfaces that every collection should implement:
* **`Iterable`** to support `for`, `unpacking`, and other forms of iteration;
* **`Sized`** to support the `len()`built-in function;
* **`Container`** to support the `in` operator.
Three very important specializations of `Collections` are:
* **`Sequence`**, formalizing the interface of built-ins like **`list`** and `str`;
* **`Mapping`**, implemented by **`dict`**, `collections.defaultdict`, etc.;
* **`Set`**, the interface of the **`set`** and `frozenset` built-in types.
Only `Sequence` is `Reversible`, because sequences support arbitrary ordering of their contents.

>[!info] Special Method
>Here's the *The Python Language Reference* official Python Documentation where more than 80 special method names are listed: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html

# Why len is not a Method
As we already anticipated in [How Special Methods are used](#How%20Special%20Methods%20are%20used), `len(x)` runs very fast when `x` is an instance of a built-in type. No method is called for the built-in objects of CPython: the length is simply read from a field in a C struct.
