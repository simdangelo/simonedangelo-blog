> [!success] Fundamental Claim
> In Python, **Variables are Labels, not Boxes**.
# Variables are not Boxes
"**Variable as boxes**" is not the right metaphor to understand reference variable in OOP languages and here's why. Let's consider this code:
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
```
1. Create a list `[1, 2, 3]` and **bind** the variable `a` to it;
2. **Bind** the variable `b` to the same value that `a` is referencing.
If you imagine variables are like **boxes**, you can't make sense of assignment in Python; instead, think **variables** as **sticky notes**, as the following image shows:
![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240704194833.png)
If we consider it this way, the output of the following code, which might seem strange at first, is actually perfectly explainable:
``` terminal
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = a
>>> a.append(4)
>>> b
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```
Indeed, the `b = a` statement **does not copy the contents** of box `a` into box `b`. Instead, it **attaches the label `b` to the object that already has the label `a`**.
> [!note]- The Assignment Statement Syntax
> Details about assignment statement syntax [here](https://realpython.com/python-assignment-operator/#the-assignment-statement-syntax). Very shortly: Variable assignment in Python involves **storing the reference (memory address) of the object in the left-hand variable**. This step creates a new variable if it doesn’t already exist or updates the reference of an existing variable to point to a new object.

When we see `a = "hello"` we would say: "Variable `a` is assigned to the string `"hello"`" and not "The string `"hello"` is assigned to the variable `a`". That's because the object `"hello"` is created before the assignment, and we'll prove that in the next piece of code.

Since the verb "to assign" is used in contradictory ways, a useful alternative is "**to bind**": Python **assignment statement `x = ...` binds the `x` variable** (or **label**) **to the object created or referenced on the righthand side**. And, again, the object must exists before a name can be bound do it, as this example will prove:
```python
class Gizmo:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        print(f"Gizmo id: {id(self)}")

x = Gizmo()
y = Gizmo()*10
```
Output:
```
Gizmo id: 4584236384
Gizmo id: 4584237776
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[68], line 6
      3         print(f"Gizmo id: {id(self)}")
      5 x = Gizmo()
----> 6 y = Gizmo()*10

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'Gizmo' and 'int'
```
* The first class instantiation works as expected.
* The second class instantiation is the proof that the second `Gizmo` was actually instantiated before the multiplication was attempted, and the variable `y` was never created.
# Identity, Equality, and Aliases
Because variables are mere labels, nothing prevents an object from having several labels assigned to it. When that happens, you have **Aliasing**.
Here's an example:
``` terminal {4,6,9}
>>> charles = {'name': 'Charles L. Dodgson', 'born': 1832}
>>> lewis = charles
>>> lewis is charles
True
>>> id(charles), id(lewis)
(11765609536, 11765609536)
>>> lewis['balance'] = 950
>>> charles
{'name': 'Charles L. Dodgson', 'born': 1832, 'balance': 950}
```
* Line 2: `lewis` is an **alias** for `charles`.
* Line 3 / Line 5: the `is` operator and the `id` function confirm it.
* Line 7: adding an item to `lewis` is the same as adding an item to `charles`.
This is an example of **Aliasing**.

Let's suppose an impostor - called Dr. Alexander - claims he is Charles L. Dodgson born in 1832. Here's the current situation:
![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240704220524.png)
Let's represent this situation with code:
``` terminal {2,4}
>>> alex = {'name': 'Charles L. Dodgson', 'born': 1832}
>>> alex == charles
True
>>> alex is charles
False
```
* `charles` and `lewis` are bound to the same object;
* `alex` is bound to a separate object of equal value.
So, `alex == charles` returns `True` because of the `__eq__` implementation in the `dict` class (**Equality**), but they're distinct objects and that is proved by the `False` returned by `alex is charles`.

To sum up:
* `lewis` and `charles` are **aliases** since these two variables are bound to the same object.
* `alex` is **not an alias** for `charles` since these two variables are bound to different object.

> [!note] The `is` operator and the `id` function: **Identity**
> The [Python Language reference ](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types) states:
> > [!cite]
> > An object's identity never changes once it's created; [...]. The `is` operator compares the identity of two objects. The `id()` function returns an integer representing its identity

The real meaning of the integer value returned by the `id()` function is implementation dependent. In CPython, `id()` returns the memory address of the object, but it may be something else in another Python interpreter. Regardless of the specific meaning, the **ID value** returned by this function is guarantee to be a **unique integer label, and it will never change during the life of the object**.
## Choosing between `==` and `is`
* The `==` operator compares the values of objects (the data they hold);
* The `is` operator compares their identities (the integer value returned by the `id()` function).
While programming, we are often interested in **object equality** than **identity**, so `==` appears more frequently than `is` in Python code. However, if you are comparing a variable to a singleton, ti makes sense to use `is`. The most common case (maybe the *only* common case) is checking whether a variable is bound to `None`.
* The `is` operator is faster than `==`, because it cannot be overloaded (*maybe overridden??*), so Python does not have to find and invoke special methods to evaluate it.
* The `==` operator is syntactic sugar for `a.__eq__(b)`. The `__eq__` method inherited from `object` compared object IDs, so it produces the same result as `is`. But most built-in types override `__eq__` method with more meaningful implementation that takes into account the values of the object attributes.
## The Relative Immutability of Tuple
Tuples, like most **Python collections** - like lists, dict, sets, etc. - are **containers**: they hold references to objects. in contrast, flat sequences like `str`, `bytes`, and `array.array` directly hold their contents in contiguous memory.
>[!attention]
>So, the **Immutability of Tuples** really refers to the physical content of the `tuple` data structure, that corresponds to the references it holds, and does not extend to the referenced objects.

Let's explore a situation where the value of the tuple changes, but not the identity of the item it contains:
```terminal {3,5,10,12}
>>> t1 = (1, 2, [30, 40])
>>> t2 = (1, 2, [30, 40])
>>> t1 == t2
True
>>> id(t1[-1])
5062094208
>>> t1[-1].append(99)
>>> t1
(1, 2, [30, 40, 99])
>>> id(t1[-1])
5062094208
>>> t1 == t2
False
```
* Line 3: `t1` and `t2` compare equals (equality), although distinct object.
* Line 5: `t1` is immutable, while `t1[-1]` is not, and that one is its ID.
* Line 10: after modifying `t1[-1]` in place, its identity has not changed, but its value has.
* Line 12: now `t1` and `t2` are different.

The distinction between **equality** and **identity** has further implication when you need to copy an object.
# Copies are Shallow by Default
The easiest way to copy a list (or most built-in mutable collections) is to use the built-in constructor for the type itself:
```terminal {3,5}
>>> l1 = [3, [55, 44], (7, 8, 9)]
>>> l2 = list(l1) # copy of l1; alternative: l2=l1[:]
>>> l2==l1
True
>>> l2 is l1
False
```
(As expected, `l1` and `l2` compare equal, but they're different objects.)

Using constructor or [:] produces a **shallow copy**, meaning that the outermost container is duplicated, but the copy is filled with references to the same items held by the original container. Is these items are mutable items, this may lead to unpleasant surprises.

Let's take the previous code and add something:
```python {3,4,7,8}
l1 = [3, [55, 44], (7, 8, 9)]
l2 = list(l1)
l1.append(100)
l1[1].remove(55)
print('l1:', l1)
print('l2:', l2)
l2[1] += [33, 22]
l2[2] += (10, 11)
print('l1:', l1)
print('l2:', l2)
```
Output:
```
l1: [3, [44], (7, 8, 9), 100]
l2: [3, [44], (7, 8, 9)]
l1: [3, [44, 33, 22], (7, 8, 9), 100]
l2: [3, [44, 33, 22], (7, 8, 9, 10, 11)]
```
Important things to note:
* Line 3: **only `l1` is affected** because a tuple is **immutable**;
* Line 4: **both `l1` and `l2` are affected** because`l1[1]` is a list (**mutable**) and the operator `+=` changes the list in place;
* Line 7: **both `l1` and `l2` are affected** because `l2[1]` is a list (**mutable**) and the operator `+=` changes the list in place;
* Line 8: **only `l2` is affected** because `l2[2]` is a tuple (**immutable**)and the operator `+=` creates a new tuple and rebind the variable `l2[2]` to this new tuple.

Here's an amazing interactive tool that help us to graphically visualize this process step by step:

## Deep and Shallow Copies of Arbitrary Objects
Sometimes you need to make **deep copies**, meaning duplicates that do not share references of embedded objects. The `copy` module provides the `deepcopy` and `copy` functions that return deep and shallow copies of arbitrary objects.

Let's show an example:
```python
from copy import copy, deepcopy

list1 = [1, [2,3], 4]
list2 = copy(list1)
list3 = deepcopy(list1)

list1[1].append(3)
print('list1: ', list1)
print('list2: ', list2)
print('list3: ', list3)
```
Output:
```
list1:  [1, [2, 3, 3], 4]
list2:  [1, [2, 3, 3], 4]
list3:  [1, [2, 3], 4]
```
It's clear that, if I modify a mutable object of `list1`, only `list2` is affected because it's a shallow copy.

# Function Parameters as References
The only mode of **parameter passing** in Python is **Call by Sharing**.
> [!info] Call by Sharing
>**Call by Sharing** means that each formal parameter of the function gets a copy of each reference in the arguments. In other words, the **parameters inside the function become aliases of the actual arguments**.

(*The above one is the explanation contained in the book, but honestly I don't like it. The following is an explanation found on the web that looks more clear to me: [click here](https://qissba.com/parameter-passing-method-in-python/#Question_How_are_arguments_passed_by_value_or_by_reference_in_python)*)

In Python, arguments are passed **By Assignment**, which means that the function parameters are assigned the values of the arguments that are passed to them. Whether the argument is passed by value or by reference depends on the type of the argument.
* **Immutable objects** (like strings, integers, tuples) are passed **by value**. This means that when you pass an immutable object to a function, a copy of the object is created, and the function works with this copy rather than the original object. Any changes made to the copy will not affect the original object:
	```python
	def add_function(a, b):
	    a += b
	    return a
	    
	x = 1
	y = 2
	
	print("Before:", f"x = {x}", f"y = {y}", "-"*20, sep='\n')
	result1 = add_function(x, y)
	print("After:", f"x = {x}", f"y = {y}", f"result1 = {result1}", sep='\n')
	```
	Output:
	```
	Before:
	x = 1
	y = 2
	--------------------
	After:
	x = 1
	y = 2
	result1 = 3
	```
	In this example, `x` is an integer object (which is **immutable**), and it is passed to the `f` function. Inside the function, a copy of `x` is created, and the copy is modified by adding 1 to it. However, the original `x` object remains unchanged, and when the function is done, the modified copy is discarded.
* **Mutable objects** (like lists, dictionaries, sets) are passed **by reference**. This means that when you pass a mutable object to a function, **the function receives a reference to the original object**. **Any changes made to the object inside the function will affect the original object**:
	```python
	list1 = [1, 2]
	list2 = [3, 4]
	
	print("Before:", f"list1: {list1}", f"list2: {list2}", "-"*20, sep='\n')
	result2 = add_function(list1, list2)
	print("After:", f"list1: {list1}", f"list2: {list2}", f"Result2: {result2}", sep='\n')
	```
	Output:
	```
	Before:
	list1: [1, 2]
	list2: [3, 4]
	--------------------
	After:
	list1: [1, 2, 3, 4]
	list2: [3, 4]
	Result2: [1, 2, 3, 4]
	```
	That's what happens with mutable objects: since function `f` has an in-place operator, it changed `list1` because it's mutable (look at line 6). Before fixing this issue, we'll show another related problem and then we'll show a solution for both issues.
## Mutable Types as Parameter Default: Bad Idea!
You should **avoid mutable objects** as **default values for parameters**. That's because each default value is evaluated when the function is defined. So, if a default value is a mutable object, and you change it, the change will affect every future call of the function.

Here's an example (*This example is not taken from the book. The following one is much simpler to understand.*):
```python
def append_to_list(value, my_list: list =[]):
    my_list.append(value)
    return my_list

print("First call:", append_to_list(1))  # Expected: [1]
print("Second call:", append_to_list(2))  # Expected: [2] but actually [1, 2]
print("Third call:", append_to_list(3))  # Expected: [3] but actually [1, 2, 3]
```
Output:
```
First call: [1]
Second call: [1, 2]
Third call: [1, 2, 3]
```
- **First Call**: When the function is called with `append_to_list(1)`, it appends `1` to the list and returns `[1]`.
- **Second Call**: When the function is called again with `append_to_list(2)`, it appends `2` to the existing list (which already contains `[1]`) and returns `[1, 2]` instead of `[2]`.
- **Third Call**: Similarly, when called with `append_to_list(3)`, it appends `3` to the list which now contains `[1, 2]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`.
**Problem**: When `my_list` is given a default value of an empty list, it becomes an alias (=a reference) to that list object. After the first function call, `my_list` contains `[1]`. So, on subsequent calls, `my_list` is no longer empty! As a result, the second call to the function sees `my_list` as `[1]` instead of an empty list.
### Solution (not the real solution)
To avoid this issue, use `None` as the default value and initialize the mutable object inside the function:
```python
def append_to_list_fix(value, my_list: list = None):
    if my_list is None:
        my_list = []
    my_list.append(value)
    return my_list

print("First call:", append_to_list_fix(1))  # Expected: [1]
print("Second call:", append_to_list_fix(2))  # Expected: [2]
print("Third call:", append_to_list_fix(3))  # Expected: [3]
```
Output:
```
First call: [1]
Second call: [2]
Third call: [3]
```

Actually, a potential problem can still arise. If I want to apply this function to an **existing list** leads to another undesirable results:
```python
def append_to_list_fix(value, my_list: list = None):
    if my_list is None:
        my_list = []
    my_list.append(value)
    return my_list

existing_list = [90, 91, 92]

print("First call:", append_to_list_fix(1, existing_list)) # Expected: [90, 91, 92, 1]
print("Second call:", append_to_list_fix(2, existing_list)) # Expected: [90, 91, 92, 2] but actually [90, 91, 92, 1, 2]
print("Third call:", append_to_list_fix(3, existing_list)) # Expected: [90, 91, 92, 3] but actually [90, 91, 92, 1, 2, 3]
```
Output:
```
First call: [90, 91, 92, 1]
Second call: [90, 91, 92, 1, 2]
Third call: [90, 91, 92, 1, 2, 3]
```
The problem now is the same as before: `my_list` becomes an alias for `existing_list`. So, since at the end of first iteration `my_list` is equal to `[90, 91, 92, 1]`, even `existing_list` becomes now equal to `[90, 91, 92, 1]`.

### Solution (the real solution)
To fix this second scenario the solution is simple: if `my_list` is provided, it should be initialized with a copy of that list:
```python
def append_to_list_fix_definitive(value, my_list: list = None):
    if my_list is None:
        my_list = []
    else:
        my_list = list(my_list) # Alternative: my_list = copy(my_list)
    my_list.append(value)
    return my_list

existing_list = [90, 91, 92]

print("First call:", append_to_list_fix_definitive(1, existing_list)) # Expected: [90, 91, 92, 1]
print("Second call:", append_to_list_fix_definitive(2, existing_list)) # Expected: [90, 91, 92, 2]
print("Third call:", append_to_list_fix_definitive(3, existing_list)) # Expected: [90, 91, 92, 3]
```
Output:
```
First call: [90, 91, 92, 1]
Second call: [90, 91, 92, 2]
Third call: [90, 91, 92, 3]
```

We have finally fixed both scenarios: using an **empty list** as the default argument and passing an **existing list** to the function.
# `del` and Garbage Collection
>[!cite] "Data Model" chapter of *The Python Language Reference*
>Objects are never explicitly destroyed; however, when they become unreachable they may be garbage-collected.

1. **`del` is not a function, it's a statement**. Indeed we write `del x` and not `del(x)` (although the latter also works, but only because the expressions `x` and `(x)` usually means the same thing in Python.
2. **`del` deletes references, not objects**. Python's Garbage Collector may discard an object from memory as an indirect result of `del`, if the deleted variable was the last reference to the object
Here's an example of `del` usage:
```terminal
>>> a = [1,2]
>>> b = a
>>> del a
>>> b
[1, 2]
>>> b = [3]
```
* Line 1 & 2: create object `[1, 2]` and bind `a` and `b` to it.
* Line 3: delete reference `a`.
* Line 5: rebinding `b` to the new object `[3]` removes the last remaining reference to `[1, 2]`. Now the garbage collector can discard that object.

In CPython, the primary algorithm for garbage collection is **reference counting**. Essentially, each object keeps count of how many references point to it. As soon as that *refcount* reaches zero, the object is immediately destroyed. For a further investigation, look at [How Variables works in Python](Python/How%20Variables%20works%20in%20Python.md).
