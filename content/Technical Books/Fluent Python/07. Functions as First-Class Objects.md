**Functions** in Python are **First-Class Objects**. Programming language researches define a "**first-class object**" as a program entity that can be:
* **created at runtime**;
* **assigned to a variable or element in a data structure**;
* **passed as an argument to a function**;
* **returned as the result of a function**.

Having functions as first-class objects is an essential feature of **Functional Programming**. However, this concept is so useful that it has been adopted by "non-functional programming" languages.
# Treating a Function like an Object
Let' prove that **functions** are **objects** in Python:
```terminal
>>> def factorial(n):
... 	   """returns n!"""
... 	   return 1 if n < 2 else n * factorial(n-1)

>>> factorial(42)
1405006117752879898543142606244511569936384000000000

>>> factorial.__doc__
returns n!

>>> type(factorial)
<class 'function'>
```
* This is a console session, so we're creating a function at "runtime".
* `__doc__` is one of several attributes of function objects.
* `factorial` is an instance of the `function` class.

Now let's take `factorial` function as example and we'll show the "**first-class**" nature of a `function` object:
``` terminal {1,4,6}
>>> fact = factorial
>>> fact
<function __main__.factorial(n)>
>>> fact(5)
120
>>> list(map(factorial, range(11)))
[1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800]
```
 
In this example we could:
- *Line 1 - Line 4*: **assign it to a variable** `fact` with an assignment operator without the parenthesis and call it through that name;
- *Line 6*: **pass `factorial` as an argument to another function** (known as higher-order function), `map` in our case.

>[!info]- `map` function
> Calling `map(function, iterable)` returns an iterable where each item is the result of calling the first argument (a function) to successive elements of the second argument (an iterable). More details on the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map).
# Higher-Order Functions
A function is a "**higher-order function**" if:
+ **takes a function as an argument** or
+ **returns a function as the result**.

Example with `key` argument in `sorted()` function, which let us provide a function to be applied to each item for sorting:
``` terminal
>>> fruits = ["strawberry", "apple", "cherry"]
>>> sorted(fruits, key=len)
['apple', 'cherry', 'strawberry']
```

Any one-argument function can be used as `key`. For example, to create a rhyme dictionary it might be useful to sort each word spelled backward:
``` terminal {5}
>>> def reverse(word):
...     return word[::-1]
>>> reverse('testing')
'gnitset'
>>> sorted(fruits, key=reverse)
['apple', 'strawberry', 'cherry']
```

In the Functional Programming paradigm, some of the best known higher-order functions are: 
+ `apply` (deprecated in Python 2.3 and removed in Python 3);
+ `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` (although better alternatives are available).
### Modern Replacements for `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`
#### `map` and`filter`functions
`map` and`filter` are built-ins in Python 3, but, since they both return generators (a form of iterator), their combination is often replaced by **list comprehensions** and **generator expressions**:
``` terminal
>>> list(map(factorial, range(6)))
[1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120]

>>> [factorial(n) for n in range(6)]
[1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120]

>>> list(map(factorial, filter(lambda n: n%2, range(6))))
[1, 6, 120]

>>> [factorial(n) for n in range(6) if n%2]
[1, 6, 120]
```
#### `reduce` function
The `reduce` function was demoted from a built-in in Python 2 to the `functools` module in Python 3. Its most common use case, summation, is better served by the `sum` built-in:
```terminal {3,6}
>>> from functools import reduce
>>> from operator import add
>>> reduce(add, range(100))
4950

>>> sum(range(100))
4950
```

The common idea of `sum` and `reduce` is to **apply some operation to successive items in a series, accumulating previous results**, thus reducing a series of values to a single value.

Other reducing built-ins are:
* `all(iterable)`: returns `True` if there are not falsy elements in the iterable (`all([])` returns `True`).
* `any(iterable)`: returns `True` if any element of the `iterable` is truthy(`any([])` returns `False`)

To use a higher-order function, sometimes it's convenient to create a small, one-off function, known as **Anonymous Function**.
# Anonymous Functions
The `lambda` keyword creates an **Anonymous Function** within a Python Expression. The simple syntax of Python limits the body of the `lambda` functions to be **pure expressions** (it cannot contain other Python statements, such as `while`, `try`, etc. Assignment with `=` is also a statement, so it cannot occur in a `lambda`, but you can use the new assignment expression syntax using `:=`. However, if you need it, your `lambda` is probably too complicated and hard to read and it's better to use a regular function using `def`).

The best use of anonymous functions is in the context of an argument list for a higher-order function. For example we can rewrite the previous function `sorted(fruits, key=reverse)` without defining the `reverse` function:
```terminal
>>> sorted(fruits, key=lambda word: word[::-1])
['apple', 'strawberry', 'cherry']
```

Outside the limited context of arguments to higher-order functions, anonymous functions are rarely useful in Python.
# The Nine Flavors of Callable Objects
In Python, a **callable** isÂ **any object that you can call using a pair of parentheses and, optionally, a series of arguments**. The call operator `()` may be applied to other objects besides functions. To determine whether an object is callable , use the `callable()` built-in function.

As of Python 3.9, the data model documentation lists 9 callable types:
- **User-defined functions**: Created with `def` statements or `lambda` expressions.
- **Built-in functions**: Functions like `len()` and `print()`.
- **Built-in methods**: Methods of built-in objects, like `list.append()`.
- **Methods**: Functions defined within a class.
- **Classes**: When called, they create a new instance of the class.
- **Class Instances**: Instances of classes that implement the `__call__` method (explanation in the next paragraph).
- **Generator Functions**: Functions that yield values using the `yield` keyword, when called, return a generator object.
- **Native Coroutine Functions**
- **Asynchronous generator Functions**
# User-Defined Callable Types
Any Python object that implements the `__call__` instance method **acts like a function**. Example:
```python
import random

class BingoCage:
    def __init__(self, items):
        self._items = list(items)
        random.shuffle(self._items)

    def pick(self):
        try:
            return self._items.pop()
        except IndexError:
            raise LookupError('pick from empty BingoCage')
        
    def __call__(self):
        return self.pick()


bingo = BingoCage(range(10))
print(bingo._items)
print(bingo()) # shortcut for bingo.pick()
print(bingo())
print(bingo())
```
Output:
```
[8, 7, 6, 1, 0, 3, 2, 9, 4, 5]
5
4
9
```

A class implementing `__call__` is as easy way to create **function-like objects** that have some internal state that must be kept across invocations (in this case the internal state is represented by the remaining items in the `BingoCage`).
# From Positional to Keyword-Only Parameters
One of the best features of Python functions is the extremely **flexible parameters handling mechanism**, of which the parameters unpacking symbols like `*` and `**` are two examples. Let's create a function:
```python
def tag(name, *content, class_=None, **attrs):
    """Generate one or more HTML tags"""
    if class_ is not None:
        attrs['class'] = class_
    attr_pairs = (f' {attr}="{value}"' for attr, value in sorted(attrs.items()))
    attr_str = ''.join(attr_pairs)
    if content:
        elements = (f'<{name}{attr_str}>{c}</{name}>' for c in content)
        return '\n'.join(elements)
    else:
        return f'<{name}{attr_str} />'
```
In the terminal:
``` terminal {1,4,7,11,14,18,22}
>>> tag('br')
'<br />'

>>> tag('p', 'hello')
'<p>hello</p>'

>>> print(tag('p', 'hello', 'world'))
<p>hello</p>
<p>world</p>

>>> tag('p', 'hello', id=33)
'<p id="33">hello</p>'

>>> print(tag('p', 'hello', 'world', class_='sidebar'))
<p class="sidebar">hello</p>
<p class="sidebar">world</p>

>>> tag(content='testing', name='img')
'<img content="testing" />'

>>> my_tag = {'name': 'img', 'title': 'Sunset Boulevard', 'src': 'sunset.jpg', 'class': 'framed'}
>>> tag(**my_tag)
'<img class="framed" src="sunset.jpg" title="Sunset Boulevard" [/](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/)>' 
```
+ *Line 1*: a single *positional argument* produces an empty tag with that name.
+ *Line 4-7*: any number of *positional arguments* after the first are captured by `*content` as a tuple.
+ *Line 11*: *keyword arguments* not explicitly named in the `tag` signature are captured by `attrs` as a `dict`.
+ *Line 14*: the `class_` parameter can only be passed as a keyword argument.
+ *Line 18*: the first positional argument can also be passed as a keyword.
+ *Line 22*: prefixing `my_tag` with `**` passes all its items as separate arguments.

**Keyword-Only Arguments** are a feature of Python 3. To specify Keyword-Only Arguments when defining a function, name them after the argument prefixed with `*`. In our example, the `class_` parameter can only be given as keyword argument because it was named after `*content`. If you don't want to support positional arguments but still want keyword-only arguments, put a `*` by itself in the signature:
```python
def f(a, *, b):
    return a, b

f(1, b=2) # output: (1, 2)
f(a=1, b=2) # output: (1, 2)
f(1, 2) # output: TypeError: f() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
```
### Positional-Only Parameters
**Positional-Only Arguments** is a feature introduced since Python 3.8 for user-defined functions. To specify Positional-Only Arguments when defining a function, name them before `/` in the parameter list:
```python
def divmod(a, b, /):
	return (a//b, a%b)

divmod(10,4) # output: (2, 2)
divmod(a=10, b=4) # output: TypeError: divmod() got some positional-only arguments passed as keyword arguments: 'a, b'
```
In our previous example, we can specify `name` argument to be positional-only with this signature:
```python
def tag(name, *content, class_=None, **attrs):
	...
```
# Packages for Functional Programming
Guido van Rossum said explicitly that he did not design Python to be a Functional Programming Language. Nonetheless, a functional coding style can be used thanks to first-class functions, pattern matching, and the support of packages like `operator` and `functools`.
### The `operator`  Module
#### Arithmetic Operator
Often in functional programming it is convenient to use an **arithmetic operator as a function**. For example, you can get the summation of a sequence of numbers without recursion with built-in `sum()` by `sum([1, 2, 3])`. There is no equivalent function for multiplication. As we have already mentioned in [`reduce` function](#`reduce`%20function) paragraph above, you could compute the factorial by using`reduce` and `mul` function from `operator` module:
```python {2}
from functools import reduce
from operator import mul

def factorial(n):
	return reduce(mul, range(1, n+1))
```
instead of using a trivial function with `lambda`:
```python
from functools import reduce

def factorial(n):
	return reduce(lambda a, b: a*b, range(1, n+1))
```
#### `itemgetter` and `attrgetter`
Another group of functions that allows us to avoid `lambda` consists of `itemgetter` and `attrgetter`.

A common use of `itemgetter` is to sort a list of tuples by the value of one field:
```python
from operator import itemgetter

metro_data = [
    ('Tokyo', 'JP', 36.933, (35.689722, 139.691667)),
    ('Delhi NCR', 'IN', 21.935, (28.613889, 77.208889)),
    ('Mexico City', 'MX', 20.142, (19.433333, -99.133333)),
    ('New York-Newark', 'US', 20.104, (40.808611, -74.020386)),
    ('SÃ£o Paulo', 'BR', 19.649, (-23.547778, -46.635833))
    ]

for city in sorted(metro_data, key=itemgetter(1)):
    print(city)
```
instead of using a trivial function with `lambda`:
```python
for city in sorted(metro_data, key=lambda x: x[1]):
    print(city)
```

What is happened is that `itemgetter(1)` creates a function that, given a collection, returns the item at index 1.

Another common use of `itemgetter` is to retrieve items from collections such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries:
```python
cc_name = itemgetter(2,0)

for city in metro_data:
    print(cc_name(city))
```
Output:
```
(36.933, 'Tokyo')
(21.935, 'Delhi NCR')
(20.142, 'Mexico City')
(20.104, 'New York-Newark')
(19.649, 'SÃ£o Paulo')
```

Since `itemgetter` uses the `[]` operator, it supports not only sequences but also any class that implements `__getitem__`.
