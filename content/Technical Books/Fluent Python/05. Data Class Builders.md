**Data Class** is a Python data structure that we use to build a **simple class that is just a collection of fields, with little or no extra functionality**

We'll see three different **class builders** that we can use to build data classes:
1. `collections.namedtuple`
2. `typing.NamedTuple`
3. `@dataclasses.dataclass`

> [!attention]
> `typing.TypedDict` may seem like another data class builders. However, `TypedDict` does not build concrete classes that you can instantiate. It's just syntax to write type hints for function parameters and variables that will accept mapping values used as records, with keys as field names.
# 1. Overview of Data Class Builders
Let's consider a simple class and show its limitation and then we'll rewrite it with the three solutions mentioned above:
```python
class Coordinate:
	def __init__(self, lat, lon):
		self.lat = lat
		self.lon = lon

moscow = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)
location = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)
```
Then:
```terminal {2,5,8}
>>> moscow
<__main__.Coordinate object at 0x10452bf40>

>>> location == moscow
False

>>> (location.lat, location.lon) == (moscow.lat, moscow.lon)
True
```

Problems:
* To store `lat` and `len` we had to write those words 3 times;
* Line 1: `__repr__` inherited from `object` is not very helpful;
* Line 2: meaningless `==` operator because the `__eq__` method inherited from `object` **compares objects IDs**;
* Line 3: comparing two coordinates requires explicit comparison of each attribute.
## 1.1. `collection.namedtuple` implementation
`collection.namedtuple` is a factory function that builds a **subclass of `tuple`** with the name and fields we specify:
```python
from collections import namedtuple

Coordinate = namedtuple("Coordinate", "lat lon")

moscow = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)
location = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)
```
Then:
```terminal {2,5,8}
>>> issubclass(Coordinate, tuple)
True

>>> moscow
Coordinate(lat=55.76, lon=37.62)

>>> location == moscow
True
```
* Line 1: it's a `tuple` subclass;
* Line 2: useful `__repr__`;
* Line 3: meaningful `__eq__`.
## 1.2. `typing.NamedTuple` implementation
This function **adds a type annotation** to each fields and it builds a **subclass of `tuple`**. Basically, it's a typed version of `namedtuple`:
```python
import typing

# Alternative 1
Coordinate = typing.NamedTuple("Coordinate", [("lat", "float"), ("lon", "float")])
# Alternative 2
Coordinate = typing.NamedTuple("Coordinate", lat=float, lon=float)

moscow = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)
location = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)
```
The output is the same as the `collection.namedtuple` case:
```terminal {2,5,8}
>>> issubclass(Coordinate, tuple)
True

>>> moscow
Coordinate(lat=55.76, lon=37.62)

>>> location == moscow
True
```

The "*Alternative 2*" in the above example is much more readable but there's another even more readable way we can use. Indeed, since Python 3.6, `typing.NamedTuple` can also be used in a `class` statement, with type annotations. This is indeed much more readable, and makes it easy to override methods or add new one:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple

class Coordinate(NamedTuple):
	lat: float
	lon: float

	def __str__(self):
		ns = "N" if self.lat >= 0 else "S"
		we = "E" if self.lon >= 0 else "W"
		return f"{abs(self.lat):.1f}°{ns}, {abs(self.lon):.1f}°{we}"
```
>[!info]
>Although `NamedTuple` appears in the `class` statement as a superclass, **it's actually not**:
>```terminal
>>>> issubclass(Coordinate, NamedTuple)
>False
>
>>>> issubclass(Coordinate, tuple)
>True
>```

*Note that this is not the result i got in my Jupyter notebook. The expression `issubclass(Coordinate, NamedTuple)` returns an error to me. This "error" is also present in the "Unconfirmed Errata" of this book on the O'Reilly website.*
## 1.3. `@dataclasses.dataclass` implementation
The class built with `@dataclasses.dataclass` method is a **subclass of `object`**:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Coordinate:
    lat: float
    lon: float

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        ns = "N" if self.lat >= 0 else "S"
        we = "E" if self.lon >= 0 else "W"
        return f"{abs(self.lat):.1f}°{ns}, {abs(self.lon):.1f}°{we}"
    
moscow = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)
location = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)
```
Of course, even in this third case, the output is the same as the both `collection.namedtuple` and `typing.NamedTuple` cases:
```terminal {2,5,8}
>>> issubclass(Coordinate, object)
True

>>> moscow
Coordinate(lat=55.76, lon=37.62)

>>> location == moscow
True
```

## 1.4. Main Features
The following table summarises the similarities between these three data class builders:
![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240928113523.png)

**Mutable Instances**
* Both `collections.namedtuple` and `typing.NamedTuple` build `tuple` subclasses, therefore the instances are **immutable**.
* By default, `@dataclass`produces **mutable** classes. When `frozen=True`, the class will raise an exception if you try to assign a value to a field after the instance is initialized.

**Class statement syntax**
* Only `typing.NamedTuple`and `@dataclass` supports regular `class` statement syntax, making it easier to add methods and docstrings.

**Construct `dict`**
* Both `collections.namedtuple` and `typing.NamedTuple` provide an instance method (`._asdict`) to construct a `dict` object from the fields in a data class instance:
```terminal {1}
>>> new_dictionary = moscow._asdict()
>>> new_dictionary
{'lat': 55.76, 'lon': 37.62}
```
* The `dataclasses` module provides a function to do it: `dataclasses.asdict()`.
```terminal {1}
>>> from dataclasses import asdict

>>> d = asdict(moscow)
>>> d
{'lat': 55.76, 'lon': 37.62}
```

**Get field names and default values**
* All three class builders let us define the field names and default values.
* In `typing.NamedTuple` instances, that metadata is in the `._fields` and `._fields_defaults` class attributes:
```terminal {1,4}
>>> moscow._fields
('lat', 'lon')

>>> moscow._field_defaults
{}
```
* `@dataclass` decorated class uses the `fields` function from the `dataclasses` module:
```terminal
>>> from dataclasses import fields
>>> fields(moscow)
(Field(name='lat',type=<class 'float'>,default=<dataclasses._MISSING_TYPE object at 0x1032b5b40>,default_factory=<dataclasses._MISSING_TYPE object at 0x1032b5b40>,init=True,repr=True,hash=None,compare=True,metadata=mappingproxy({}),kw_only=False,_field_type=_FIELD),
 Field(name='lon',type=<class 'float'>,default=<dataclasses._MISSING_TYPE object at 0x1032b5b40>,default_factory=<dataclasses._MISSING_TYPE object at 0x1032b5b40>,init=True,repr=True,hash=None,compare=True,metadata=mappingproxy({}),kw_only=False,_field_type=_FIELD))
```

**Get field types**
* Class defined by `typing.NamedTuple` and `@dataclass` have an `__annotations__` attribute holding the type hints for the fields. However it's not recommended; instead, the recommended best practice is to get information with `inspect.get_annotations(MyClass)` or `typing.get_type_hints(MyClass)`:
```terminal {4,7,10}
>>> from typing import get_type_hints
>>> import inspect

>>> Coordinate.__annotations__
{'lat': <class 'float'>, 'lon': <class 'float'>}

>>> inspect.get_annotations(Coordinate)
{'lat': <class 'float'>, 'lon': <class 'float'>}

>>> get_type_hints(Coordinate)
{'lat': <class 'float'>, 'lon': <class 'float'>} 
```

**New instances with changes**
* Given a named tuple instance `x`, the call `x._replace(**kwargs)` returns a new instance with some attribute values replaced.
* The `dataclasses.replace(x, **kwargs)` does the same for an instance of a `dataclass` decorated class.
# 2. Classic Named Tuples
The `collections.namedtuple` function is a **factory that builds subclasses of `tuple`** enhanced with fields names, a class name, and an informative `__repr__`.

Classes built with `namedtuple` can be used anywhere where tuples are needed. Each instance of a class takes the same amount of memory as a tuple.

Let's define a named tuple type:
```python
from collections import namedtuple

City = namedtuple("City", "name country population coordinates")
tokyo = City("Tokyo", "JP", 36.933, (35.689722, 139.691667))
```
Then:
```terminal
>>> tokyo
City(name='Tokyo', country='JP', population=36.933, coordinates=(35.689722, 139.691667))

>>> tokyo.population
36.933

>>> tokyo.coordinates
(35.689722, 139.691667)

>>> tokyo[1]
JP
```

In addition to some methods inherited from `tuple`, such as `__eq__`, `__lt__`, a named tuple offers a few useful attributes and methods, such as `_fields`, `_make(iterable)`, `_asdict()`:
```terminal {1,6,7,14}
>>> City._fields
('name', 'country', 'population', 'coordinates')

>>> Coordinate = namedtuple("Coordinate", "lat lon")
>>> delhi_data = ("Delhi NCR", "In", 21.935, Coordinate(28.613889, 77.208889))
>>> delhi = City._make(delhi_data)
>>> delhi._asdict()
{'name': 'Delhi NCR',
 'country': 'In',
 'population': 21.935,
 'coordinates': Coordinate(lat=28.613889, lon=77.208889)}

>>> import json
>>> json.dumps(delhi._asdict())
'{"name": "Delhi NCR", "country": "In", "population": 21.935, "coordinates": [28.613889, 77.208889]}'
```
Note that at *Line 14* we used `._asdict()` to serialize the data in JSON format, for example.

# 3. Typed Named Tuples
`typing.NamedTuple` is a typed version of `namedtuple` and, indeed, **type annotations** is its main feature:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple

class Coordinate(NamedTuple):
	lat: float
	lon: float
	reference: str = 'WGS84'
```
# 4. Type Hints 101
**Type Hints**, aka **Type Annotations**, are ways to **declare the expected type of function arguments, return values, variables, and attributes**.

> [!attention] No Runtime Effect
> **Type Hints** are **not enforced at all by the Python bytecode compiler and interpeter**. Think about Type Hints as "documentation that can be verified by IDEs and type checkers (such as *Mypy*)". That's because type hints have **no impact on the runtime behaviour** of Python programs.

Both `typing.NamedTuple` and `@dataclass` sue the syntax of variable annotations defined in *PEP 526 – Syntax for Variable Annotations*. The basic syntax of variable annotation is:
```python
var_name: some_type
```
where `some_type` can be:
+ a concrete class, such as `str` or `Coordinate`;
+ a parametrized collection type, such as `list[int]`, `tuple[str, float]`;
+ an optional type, such as `typing.Optional[str]` meaning that the attribute can be a `str` or `None`.

You can also define a **default value** for an attribute, which will be used if the corresponding argument is omitted in the constructor call.
## 4.1. The meaning of variable Annotations
Even though type hints have no effect at runtime, Python read them when a module is loaded, to build the `__annotations__` dictionary.
### 4.1.1. Plain Class
Let's start to see this in a simple plain class:
```python
class DemoPlainClass:
    a: int
    b: float = 1.1
    c = 'spam'
```
Then:
```terminal
>>> DemoPlainClass.__annotations__
{'a': int, 'b': float}
```
+ `a` becomes an entry in `__annotations__`, but doesn't become a *class attribute*;
+ `b` becomes an entry in `__annotations__`, and becomes a *class attribute*;
+ `c` doesn't become an entry in `__annotations__`, but becomes a *class attribute*.

Let's prove all these points:
```terminal
>>> DemoPlainClass.__annotations__
{'a': int, 'b': float}

>>> DemoPlainClass.a
AttributeError: type object 'DemoPlainClass' has no attribute 'a'

>>> DemoPlainClass.b
1.1

>>> DemoPlainClass.c
spam
```
### 4.1.2. `typing.NamedTuple`
Let's create the same class as before:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple

class DemoNTClass(NamedTuple):
    a: int
    b: float = 1.1
    c = 'spam'
```
+ `a` becomes an entry in `__annotations__`, and it become an *instance attribute*;
+ `b` becomes an entry in `__annotations__`, and becomes an *instance attribute*;
+ `c` doesn't become an entry in `__annotations__`, and becomes a *class attribute*.

Let's prove all these points:
```terminal
>>> DemoNTClass.__annotations__
{'a': int, 'b': float}

>>> DemoNTClass.a
_tuplegetter(0, 'Alias for field number 0')

>>> DemoNTClass.b
_tuplegetter(1, 'Alias for field number 1')

>>> DemoNTClass.c
spam
```
As expected we have the same type annotations dictionary as the previous example. However, now we have that `typing.NamedTuple` creates `a` and `b` class attributes (`c` is just a plain class attribute with the value `spam`).

*(Actually i don't understand why:*
+ *Just a little bit above, you defined `a` and `b` as instance attributes, and now class attributes;*
+ *`DemoNTClass.b` doesn't return `1.1`, which is the default value, while `DemoNTClass.c` does.*
*)*

The `a` and `b` class attributes are **descriptors**, an advanced feature. Think of them as similar to property getters: methods that don't require the explicit call operator `()` to retrieve an instance attribute. This means that they word as read-only instance attributes, which makes sense when we recall that `DemoNTClass` instances are just tuples, and tuples are immutable.
### 4.1.3. `@dataclass`
Let's create the same class as before:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class DemoDataClass:
    a: int
    b: float = 1.1
    c = 'spam'
```
+ `a` becomes an entry in `__annotations__`, and it become an *instance attribute* controlled by a descriptor;
+ `b` becomes an entry in `__annotations__`, and becomes an *instance attribute* with a descriptor;
+ `c` doesn't become an entry in `__annotations__`, and becomes a *class attribute*.

Now let's check:
```terminal
>>> DemoDataClass.__annotations__
{'a': int, 'b': float}

>>> DemoDataClass.__doc__
'DemoDataClass(a: int, b: float = 1.1)'

>>> DemoDataClass.a
AttributeError: type object 'DemoDataClass' has no attribute 'a'

>>> DemoDataClass.b
1.1

>>> DemoDataClass.c
'spam'
```
+ The `__annotations__` and `__doc__` are not surprising;
+ There is no attribute named `a` because it will only exists in instances of `DemoDataClass` and it will be a public attribute that we can get and set, unless the class is frozen. This is in contrast with `DemoNTClass`, which has a descriptor to get `a` from the instances as read-only attributes.
+ But `b` and `c` exist as class attributes, with `b` holding the default value for the `b` instance attribute, while `c` is just a class attribute that will not be bound to the instances (*Actually, what does that mean? Even in this case `c` is considered as different as `b`, but I don't understand way. Only because `c` has no type hint? It's weird if this is the reason.*).

Let's instantiate the `DemoDataClass`:
```terminal
>>> dc = DemoDataClass(9)
>>> dc.a
9

>>> dc.b
1.1

>>> dc.c
'spam'
```
`a` and `b` are instance attributes, and `c` is a class attribute we get via the instance (*Again: why?*). Remember that a data class instance built via `@dataclass` is mutable and no type checking is done at runtime:
```terminal
>>> dc.a = 10
>>> dc.b = 'oops'
>>> dc.z = 'secret stash'
```
Note that instances can have their own attributes that don't appear in the class (`z` in this case); this is normal Python behaviour. However, to save memory, avoid creating instance attributes outside of the `__init__` method (*pg. 102*).
# 5. More about @dataclass
## 5.1. Most common arguments
The `@dataclass` decorator accepts several keyword argument. Its signature is:
```python
@dataclass(*, init=True, repr=True, eq=True, order=False, unsafe_hash=False, frozen=False)
```
Here's a brief description of each one:
![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240929214316.png)
The most commonly used ones are:
* `frozen=True`: **protects against accidental changes** to the class instance. Though it could be not too hard for programmers to go around the protection afforded by this setting; indeed `@dataclass` emulates immutability by generating `__setattr__` and `__delattr__`, which raise `dataclass.FrozenInstanceError` - a subclass of `AttributeError` - when the user attempts to set or delete a field.
* `order=True`: allows sorting of instances of the data class.

If the `eq` and `frozen` arguments are both `True`, `@dataclass` produces a suitable `__hash__` method, so the instance will be hashable.
> [!info]- **Hashable** Objects
> According to [Python Glossary](https://docs.python.org/3.10/glossary.html), an object is **hashable** if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a `__hash__()` method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an `__eq__()` method). Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value. All immutable objects are hashable, but not all hashable objects are immutable. Click on the link for more details.
## 5.2. Field Options
**Mutable default values** are a common source of **bugs**. In function definitions, a mutable default value is easily corrupted when one invocation of the function mutates the default, changing the behaviour of further invocations (details on [Mutable Types as Parameter Default: Bad Idea!](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/06.%20Object%20References,%20Mutability,%20and%20Recycling.md#Mutable%20Types%20as%20Parameter%20Default%20Bad%20Idea!)). To prevent bugs, `@dataclass` rejects the class possibility to define default values in their definition:
```python
@dataclass
class ClubMember:
    game: str
    guests: list = []
```
This code returns the following `ValueError`:
```
ValueError: mutable default <class 'list'> for field guests is not allowed: use default_factory
```

A possible solution is to use `dataclass.field` function with `default_factory` as argument instead of using a literal (such as `[]`):
```python
from dataclasses import field

class ClubMember:
    game: str
    guests: list = field(default_factory=list)
```
The `default_factory` parameter could be any callable (such as a function, a class, etc.). When provided, it must be a zero-argument callable and it builds a default value each time an instance of the data class is created. This way, each instance of `ClubMember` will have its own `list`, avoiding the potential bug we mentioned above.

> [!danger] Potential bugs
> Be careful to the fact that `@dataclass` rejects class definitions only with a `list`, `dict`, and `set`. Other mutable values used as defaults will not be flagged by `@dataclass`.

Note that we can write the same class by adding a **more specific type hint**:
```python
class ClubMember:
    game: str
    guests: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)
```

The syntax `list[str]` (meaning that `guests` must be a list of strings) is a new syntax representing a **parameterized generic type**: *since Python 3.9*, the `list` built-in accepts bracket notation to specify the type of the list items. This allows type checker to find potential bugs. Note the prior to Python 3.9, the built-in collections didn't support generic type notation. So, to parametrize a data structure, you needed to import the corresponding collection types in the `typing` module (i.e. `List[str]` with `from typing import List`).
## 5.3. Post-init Processing
The `__post_init__` method allows you to perform additional actions beyond just initializing a dataclass instance. Common use cases are validation and computing field values based on other fields.
