# 1. Overview of Built-in Sequences
**Sequences** in Python (such as **strings**, **bytes**, **lists**, **tuples**, arrays, etc.) result share a rich set of common operations, including **iteration**, **slicing**, **sorting**, and **concatenation**.
> [!custom]- Additional Material
> More on Sequence in Python at this link: https://realpython.com/python-sequences/

The standard library offers a rich selection of sequence types implemented in C:
* **Container Sequences**: can hold items of different types, including nested containers (i.e. `list`, `tuple`, `collections.deque`); they hold references to the objects they contains in their own memory space.
* **Flat Sequences**: can hold items of one simple types (i.e. `str`, `bytes`, `array.array`); they contain the value of its contents it their own memory space.

Let's see the simplified memory diagrams for a `tuple` and an `array`:

> More on "How variables works in Python" at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz3ir-vKqkk&ab_channel=Sreekanth

Another way of grouping sequence types is by **mutability**:
* **Mutable Sequences**: like `list`, `bytearray`, `array.array` and `collections.deque`;
* **Immutable Sequences**: like `tuple`, `str`, and `bytes`.
A **Mutable Object** is an object that can have its value modified **in-place**.

Here's how mutable sequence inherit all methods from immutable sequences, and implement several additional methods:
![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240613195549.png)The built-in concrete sequence types do not actually subclass the `Sequence` and `MutableSequence` abstract base classes, but they're **virtual subclasses** (Chapter 13) registered with those ABCs (*TOUNDERSTAND*). Being virtual subclasses, `tuple` and `list` pass these tests:
```terminal
>>> from collections import abc

>>> issubclass(tuple, abc.Sequence)
True

>>> issubclass(list, abc.MutableSequence)
True
```
# 2. List Comprehensions and Generator Expressions
A quick way to build a sequence is using a **List Comprehensions** (aka **listcomps**) if the target is a `list`, or a **Generator Expression** (aka **genexps**) for other kind of sequences.
## 2.1. List Comprehensions and Readability
`list` is the most fundamental sequence type. Here's a `list` created with classic `for` loop:
```python
symbols = '$c£p`≠'
codes = []
for symbol in symbols:
    codes.append(ord(symbol))
```
and here's a `list` created with a **List Comprehension**:
```python
codes = [ord(symbol) for symbol in symbols]
```

The `codes` variable will be in both cases:
```
[36, 99, 163, 112, 96, 8800]
```

List Comprehensions build **lists** from **sequences or any other iterable type** by filtering and transforming items. Indeed, the `filter` and `map` built-ins can be composed to do the same, but readability suffers, as we'll see now.
## 2.2. Listcomps Versus `map` and `filter`
With list comprehension:
```python
beyond_ascii = [ord(s) for s in symbols if ord(s) > 127]
```
and with `filter` and `map` functions:
```python
beyond_ascii = list(filter(lambda symbol: symbol > 127, map(ord, symbols)))
```
## 2.3. Cartesian Products
**List comprehensions** can be used to generate lists based on the Cartesian product of two or more iterables. The Cartesian product is the set of all possible pairs (or tuples) formed by picking one element from each iterable:
```terminal
>>> colors = ["black", "white"]
>>> sizes = ["S", "M", "L"]

>>> [(color, size) for color in colors for size in sizes]
[('black', 'S'),
 ('black', 'M'),
 ('black', 'L'),
 ('white', 'S'),
 ('white', 'M'),
 ('white', 'L')]
```
## 2.4. Generator Expressions
We can also use **Generator Expressions** to initialize **tuple**, **arrays**, and **other types of sequences**:
```python
import array
symbols = '$c£p`≠'

tuple_instance = tuple(ord(symbol) for symbol in symbols)
array_instance = array.array("I", (ord(symbol) for symbol in symbols))

print(tuple_instance)
print(array_instance)
```
Output:
```
(36, 99, 163, 112, 96, 8800)
array('I', [36, 99, 163, 112, 96, 8800])
```
Note that the first argument of the  `array` constructor defines the storage type used for the numbers in the array (`I` in our case).
# 3. Tuples are not just Immutable Lists
**Tuples** as "immutable lists" is a simplification. Tuple can be used:
* as **records with no field names** (overlooked case)
* as **immutable lists**
## 3.1. Tuple as Records with no field names
Tuple holds records: each item in the tuple holds the data for one field, and the position of the item gives its meaning. This means that the number of **items is usually fixed** and their **order is always important**. Indeed, if you think of Tuples just as immutable lists, the order of the items may or may not be important, and that's not the case.

Example:
```python
lax_coordinates = (33.9425, -118.408056)
city, year, pop, chg, area = ('Tokyo', 2003, 32_450, 0.66, 8014)
```
Note that in both expression, sorting the tuple would **destroy the information**.
## 3.2. Tuple as Immutable Lists
Two benefits:
* **Clarity**: when you see a `tuple` in code, you know its length will never change;
* **Performance**: a `tuple` uses less memory than a `list` of the same length, and it allows Python to do some optimizations.
> [!attention]
> The **immutability** of a `tuple` only **applies to the references contained in it**. References in a tuple cannot be deleted or replaces. But, if one of those references points to a mutable object (like a `list`), and that object is changed, then the value of the `tuple` changes. Here's a visual representation:
>  ![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240615151912.png)

Let's explore more in detail this concept of immutability expressed in the orange box:
```terminal
>>> a = (10, 'alpha', [1, 2])
>>> b = (10, 'alpha', [1, 2])

>>> a
(10, 'alpha', [1, 2])

>>> b
(10, 'alpha', [1, 2])

>>> a==b
True
```

But, if you change the list content inside the tuple `b`, this statement is no longer valid:
```terminal
>>> b[-1].append(99)

>>> a
(10, 'alpha', [1, 2])

>>> b
(10, 'alpha', [1, 2, 99])

>>> a==b
False
```

> [!attention]
> **Tuples** with **mutable object** items can be **source of bugs**.

As we'll see later on, an object is only **Hashable** if its value cannot ever change. An **Unhashable Tuple** cannot be used as a key in a `dict` or as an element in a `set`. If you want to determine explicitly if a tuple (or any object) has a fixed value, you can use the `hash` built-in (we explore this issue further in [The Relative Immutability of Tuple](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/06.%20Object%20References,%20Mutability,%20and%20Recycling.md#The%20Relative%20Immutability%20of%20Tuple)):
```python
def fixed(o):
    try:
        hash(o)
    except TypeError:
        return False
    return True

a = (10, 'alpha', [1,2])
b = (10, 'alpha', (1,2))
c = (10, 'alpha', {'key1': "value1"})
d = (10, 'alpha', {'key2': [0,1]})
e = (10, 'alpha', 99)
```
Then:
```
>>> fixed(a)
False

>>> fixed(b)
True

>>> fixed(c)
False

>>> fixed(d)
False

>>> fixed(e)
True
```
 
 Performance advantages of using Tuple as immutable lists are explained by Python Core developer at this link [link here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68630/are-tuples-more-efficient-than-lists-in-python/22140115#22140115). To summarize:
 * To evaluate a tuple literal, the Python compiler generates bytecode for a tuple constant in one operation; but, for a list literal, the generated bytecode pushes each element as a separate constant to the data stack, and then builds the list.
 * Given a tuple `t`, `tuple(t)` simply returns a reference to the same `t`, so there's no need to copy. In contrast, given a list `l`, the `list(l)` constructor must create a new copy of `l`.
	```python
	a = (10, 20, 30)
	b = tuple(a)
	
	c = [10, 20, 30]
	d = list(a)
	```
	Then:
	```terminal
	>>> a is b
	True

	>>> c is d
	False
	```
* Because of its fixed length, a `tuple` instance is allocated the exact memory space it needs. Instance of `lists`, on the other hand, are allocated with room to spare, to amortize the cost of future appends:
	```terminal
	>>>import sys
	>>> sys.getsizeof(tuple(iter(range(10))))
	120
	
	>>> sys.getsizeof(list(iter(range(10))))
	136
	```
* The references to the items in a tuple are stored in an array in the tuple struct, wgile a list holds a pointer to an array of references stored elsewhere. This indirection is necessary because when a list grows beyond the space currently allocated, Python needs to reallocate the array of references to make room.

Note that `list` and `tuple` have different APIs:
![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241003223015.png)
# 4. Unpacking Sequences and Iterables
**Unpacking** is important because it avoids unnecessary and error-prone use of indexes to extract elements from sequences. Unpacking works with any **iterable** object as the data source - including iterators, which don't support index notation.

The most visible form of unpacking is **Parallel Assignment**: assign items from an iterable to a tuple of variables:
```python
lax_coordinates = (33.9425, -118.408056)
latitude, longitude = lax_coordinates
```
Then:
```terminal
>>> latitude
33.9425

>>> longitude
-118.408056
```

An elegant application of unpacking is **swapping the values of Variables** without using a temporary variable:
```python
b, a = a, b
```

Another example of unpacking is **prefixing an argument with `*` when calling a function**:
```terminal
>>> t = (20, 8)
>>> quotient, remainder = divmod(*t)

>>> quotient, remainder
(2, 4)
```

Indeed, if I had run the same code without `*`, I would get a `TypeError`:
```terminal {2,3}
>>> t = (20, 8)
>>> quotient, remainder = divmod(t)
TypeError: divmod expected 2 arguments, got 1
```
## 4.1. Using `*` to Grab Excess Items
Defining function parameters with `*args` to grab arbitrary excess positional arguments is a classic Python feature. This idea was extended to apply to parallel assignment:
```terminal
>>> a, b, *rest = range(5)
>>> a, b, rest
(0, 1, [2, 3, 4])

>>> a, b, *rest = range(3)
>>> a, b, rest
(0, 1, [2])

>>> a, b, *rest = range(2)
>>> a, b, rest
(0, 1, [])

>>> a, *body, c, d = range(5)
>>> a, body, c, d
(0, [1, 2], 3, 4)

>>> *head, b, c, d = range(5)
>>> head, b, c, d
([0, 1], 2, 3, 4)
```
## 4.2. Unpacking with `*` in Function Calls and Sequence Literals
(*I honestly didn't get the examples on the book, so I'll write what I think is better.*)

PEP 448 introduced more flexible syntax for iterable unpacking and a similar new syntax for `**` which we'll see later on (*TODO: insert an hyperlink as soon as you study that chapter*).

When calling a function, you can use the `*` operator to **unpack a list or tuple into individual arguments**. This is particularly useful when you want to pass a collection of arguments to a function without having to specify each one individually. For example:
```python
def add(a, b, c):
    return a + b + c

args = [1, 2, 3]
result = add(*args)
print(result)  # Output: 6
```

The`*` can also be used when defining `list`, `tuple`, or `set` literals:
```terminal
>>> *range(4), 4
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

>>> [*range(4), 4]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

>>> {*range(4), 4, *(5, 6, 7)}
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
```
# 5. Pattern Matching with Sequences (TODO)
TODO
# 6. Slicing
A common feature of `list`, `tuple`, and `str`, and all sequence types in Python is the support of **Slicing Operations**. We'll discuss some advanced use-cases.
## 6.1. Why Slices and Ranges Exclude the Last Item
The Pythonic convention of **excluding the last item in slices and ranges** works well with zero-based indexing used in Python, C, and many other languages. Convenient features:
* it's easy to see the length of a slice or range when only the stop position is given. For example both `range(3)` and `my_list[:3]` produce three items;
* it's easy to compute the length of a slice or range when start and stop are given: `stop - start`. For example:
	```python
	my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
	
	sliced_list = my_list[2:5]
	print(len(sliced_list))
	```
	Since `5-2=3` we expect `3`. Output:
	```python
	3
	``` 
* it's easy to split a sequence in two parts at any index `x`, without overlapping. For example:
	```terminal
	>>> my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
	>>> my_list[:3]
	[10, 20, 30]
	
	>>> my_list[3:]
	[40, 50, 60]	
	```
## 6.2. Slice Objects
(*This basic explanation of `::` usage is taken from ChatGPT; I just needed a compact and concise way to show a basic usage of this operator.*)

We can use slicing to access a subset of sequence by specifying a range of indices. The basic syntax for slicing is:
```python
sequence[start:stop:step]
```
where:
+ `start` is the index where the slice starts (inclusive);
+ `stop` is the index where the slice ends (exclusive);
+ `step` is the interval between elements in the slice (optional).

Considering `lst = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, let's see some common patterns with the `::` operator:
1. Omitting start, stop, and step: its means "take the entire sequence":
	```terminal
	>>> lst[::]
	[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	``` 
2. Using the `step` element: this will iterate through the entire sequence, but skip elements according to the `step` value:
	```terminal
	>>> lst[::2]
	[0, 2, 4]

	>>> lst[::3]
	[0, 3]
	``` 
3. Reversing a sequence: reverse a sequence using a negative step:
	```terminal
	>>> lst[::-1]
	[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
	```
4. **Specifying `start` or `stop` with step**: You can still specify a `start` or `stop` along with the step:
	```terminal
	>>> lst[1::2]
	[1, 3, 5]

	>>> lst[:4:2]
	[0, 2]
	```

The notation `sequence[start:stop:step]` produces a slice object: `slice(start:stop:step)`. As we'll see in *How Slicing works (TODO: add hyperlink in the future)*, to evaluate the expression `sequence[start:stop:step]`, Python calls `sequence.__getitem__(slice(start, stop, step))`. This is interesting because it allows us to assign names to slices and a potential use case could be parsing a flat-file data by naming slices:
```python
invoice = """
0.....6.................................40........52...55........
1909 Pimoroni PiBrella                      $17.50    3    $52.50
1489 6mm Tactile Switch x20                  $4.95    2    $9.90
1510 Panavise Jr. - PV-201                  $28.00    1    $28.00
1601 PiTFT Mini Kit 320x240                 $34.95    1    $34.95
"""

SKU = slice(0, 5)
DESCRIPTION = slice(5, 40)
UNIT_PRICE = slice(40, 52)
QUANTITY = slice(52, 55)
ITEM_TOTAL = slice(55, None)

line_items = invoice.split('\n')[2:]

for item in line_items:
    print(item[SKU], item[DESCRIPTION], item[UNIT_PRICE], item[QUANTITY], item[ITEM_TOTAL])
```
Output:
```
1909  Pimoroni PiBrella                       $17.50     3     $52.50
1489  6mm Tactile Switch x20                   $4.95     2     $9.90
1510  Panavise Jr. - PV-201                   $28.00     1     $28.00

```
## 6.3. Multidimensional Slicing and Ellipsis
The `[]` operator can also take **multiple indexes or slices** separated by commas. The `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` special methods that handle the `[]` operator simply receive the indices in `a[i, j]` as a tuple. For example, to evaluate `a[i, j]`, Python calls `a.__getitem__((i, j))`.

The built-in sequence types in Python are one-dimensional (except for `memoryview`), so they support only one index or slice.

However, multidimensional indexing and slicing are commonly used in external package, like NumPy. In NumPy it's possible to create multidimensional objects called `numpy.ndarray`. For instance, we can fetched two-dimensional items in a `numpy.ndarray` using the syntax `a[i, j]` or we can extract a two-dimensional slice using the syntax `a[m:n, k:l]`.

*(Ellispis: TODO. not so interesting)*
# 7. Using + and * with Sequences
Python sequences support `+` and `*` operators. Let's see both of them:

Usually both operands of `+` must be of the same sequence type:
```terminal
>>> "a " + "string"
'a string'

>>> [1, 2, 3] + [11, 12, 13]
[1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13]
```

We use `*` to concatenate multiple copies of the same sequence by multiplying it by an integer:
```terminal
>>> [1, 2, 3] * 5
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

>>> 'abcd' * 5
'abcdabcdabcdabcdabcd'
```

Note that both `+` and `*` **always creates a new object**, and never change their operands.
## 7.1. Building Lists of Lists
Sometimes we need to initialize a list with a certain number of nested lists. Pay attention because the results of some solutions may surprise us.

Let's create a list of three nested lists in the correct way and then let's modify a specific element of one of these three lists:
```terminal
>>> nested_lists = [["_"] * 2 for _ in range(3)]
>>> nested_lists
[['_', '_'], ['_', '_'], ['_', '_']]

>>> nested_lists[1][1] = "X"
>>> nested_lists
[['_', '_'], ['_', 'X'], ['_', '_']]
```

This is equivalent to:
```python
complete_list = []
for _ in range(3):
    single_nested_list = ["_"] * 2
    complete_list.append(single_nested_list) 
```
Then:
```terminal
>>> complete_list
[['_', '_'], ['_', '_'], ['_', '_']]

>>> complete_list[1][1] = "X"
>>> complete_list
[['_', '_'], ['_', 'X'], ['_', '_']]
```

This result is most probably what we wanted, so everything works well. Now let's try to re-create the same result in another way:
```terminal
>>> wrong_complete_list = [["_"] * 2] * 3
>>> wrong_complete_list
[['_', '_'], ['_', '_'], ['_', '_']]

>>> wrong_complete_list[1][1] = "X"
>>> wrong_complete_list
[['_', 'X'], ['_', 'X'], ['_', 'X']]
```

Note the weird result. This happens because the outer list (`wrong_complete_list`) is made of three references to the same inner list. Basically all the three nested lists are aliases referring to the same object. To make it more explicit, let's write the corresponding code with `for` loop:
```python
wrong_complete_list = []
single_nested_list = ["_"] * 2

for _ in range(3):
     wrong_complete_list.append(single_nested_list)
```
Then:
```terminal
>>> wrong_complete_list
[['_', '_'], ['_', '_'], ['_', '_']]

>>> wrong_complete_list[1][1] = "X"
>>> wrong_complete_list
[['_', 'X'], ['_', 'X'], ['_', 'X']]
```
## 7.2. Augmented Assignment with Sequences
The behaviour of the **augmented assignment operators** `+=` and `*=` is much different depending on the operand is applied on.

Let's show the details of `+=`, but these considerations are the same for `+=`.

The special method that make `+=` work is `__iadd__` (for "in-place addition") \[for `+=` is `__imul__`]. If `__iadd__` is not implemented, Python calls `__add__`. Let's consider `a += b`:
+ if `a` is a **mutable sequence**, `a` will be **changed in place**
+ if `a` is an **immutable sequence**, a **new object `a` will be created** because that expression is the same as `a = a + b`.

Let's make a demonstration:
```terminal {3,9,14,20}
>>> alist = [1, 2, 3]
>>> id(alist)
4470769792

>>> alist += [11, 12, 13]
>>> alist
[1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13]
>>> id(alist)
4470769792


>>> atuple = (1, 2, 3)
>>> id(atuple)
4478327040

>>> atuple += (11, 12, 13)
>>> atuple
(1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13)
>>> id(atuple)
4474998592
```
+ *Lines 3-8*: after applying the operator `+=` on a **mutable** sequence, that sequence is modified in place.
+ Lines 14-20: after applying the operator `+=` on a **immutable** sequence, a new object with the same name is created.
## 7.3. A += Assignment Puzzler
Let's run this code and then we'll make some observations:
```terminal {3,6}
>>> t = (1, 2, [30, 40])
>>> t[2] += [50, 60]
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

>>> t
(1, 2, [30, 40, 50, 60])
```

This is a weird result. What's happened:
+ `TypeError` is raised;
+ `t` becomes `(1, 2, [30, 40, 50, 60])`.

If we looked at the bytecode Python generates for the expression `s[a] += b`, it would become clearer what happens, but honestly I don't want to go into this details. The take-home messages are:
+ avoid putting mutable items in tuples;
+ augmented assignment is not an atomic operation - we just saw it throwing an exception after doing part of its job *(What does that mean? it's not so clear to me)*.

>[!note]
> Although finding working code is not the main focus of this topic, we will provide the correct code to insert new elements into a list within a tuple:
> ```terminal
> >>> t = (1, 2, [30, 40])
> >>> t[2].extend([50, 60])
> >>> t
> (1, 2, [30, 40, 50, 60])
> ```
# 8. `list.sort()` vs `sorted(list)` built-in
## 8.1. `list.sort()`
* The `list.sort()` method **sorts a list in place** - that is, without making a copy and it doesn't create a new list.
* It returns `None` to remind us that it changes the receiver (the receiver is the target of a method call, a `list` object in this case).

> [!info] Python Convention
> The last bullet point above recalls an important Python API convention: **functions or methods that changes an object in place** should return `None` (*or `NoneType`???*) to make it clear to the caller that the receiver was changes and no new object was created.
> 
> Drawback: we cannot cascade calls to those methods. In contrast, methods that return new objects can be cascaded in the fluent interface style (look at [Fluent Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface)).
## 8.2. `sorted(list)`
* The built-in function `sorted()` **creates a new list** and **returns it**.
* It accepts any iterable object as an argument, including immutable sequences and generators.

Python Sorting Algorithm is **stable**, meaning that it preserves the relative ordering of items that compare equally. For example:
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'grape', 'raspberry', 'banana']
fruits_inplace = ['apple', 'grape', 'raspberry', 'banana']

fruits_sorted_notinplace = sorted(fruits, key=len)
fruits_inplace.sort(key=len)

print(fruits_sorted_notinplace)
print(fruits_inplace)
```
Output:
```
['apple', 'grape', 'banana', 'raspberry']
['apple', 'grape', 'banana', 'raspberry']
```
As you can see, `apple` and `grape` has the same length and the sorting algorithm preserved their order.

Just as confirmation, let's see what the two sorting functions return:
```terminal {2,5}
>>> type(sorted(fruits, key=len))
list

>>> type(fruits_inplace.sort(key=len))
NoneType
```
