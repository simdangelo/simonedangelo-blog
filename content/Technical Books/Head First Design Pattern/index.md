It is a collection of notes I'm taking from the book "**Head First Design Pattern**" by **Eric Freeman & Elisabeth Robson**. When the books need clarification or integration, I'll use videos from **Christopher Okhravi's YouTube channel**, which has a great playlist about design patterns: [Design Pattern Playlist by Christopher Okhravi](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc).
