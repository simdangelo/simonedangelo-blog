# 1. Structure of Relational Database
> [!important]  
> The Relational Model defines a database abstraction based on relations to avoid maintenance overhead.  

Key tenets:
- Store DB in simple data structures (**relations**).
- **Physical** storage left up to the **DBMS implementation**. This means that it’s no longer necessary to define the physical definition of the DB (tree or has table structures). You need just to say: “Here’s my relations and attributes” and the DBMS can try to make the best decision of how it actually wants to store data.
- Access data through high-level language, **DBMS** figures out **best execution strategy**. Instead of using procedural code (Cobol, Fortran, C, etc.) to makes direct calls to the DB API, you can use an high level language to tell the DBMS that you want to do and the DBMS figure out the best way to do that.

A Relational DB (= a DB based on Relational Model) consists of a collection of tables, each of which is assigned a unique name:
- A table in Relational DB is called **Relation** (because it’s representing a relation between attributes).
- An **Attribute** refers to a column of a table.
- A **Tuple** is a set of attribute values in the relation (basically it refers to a row of a table). For each attribute there is a set of permitted values, called the **Domain** of that attribute, so tuples values must be contained in that domain. The special **NULL** value is a member of every domain (if allowed).
- A table with n columns is also called **n-ary Relation**.

# 2. Database Schema
- **Database schema**. The description of the database is called the database schema or the database **intension**. This is specified at the creation of the database. It is not expected to change very often.
- **Database instance**. The raw data that populates a database at a particular point in time is called a database instance or the **extension** of the database.

Here’s an example of these 2 aspects:
![b91e1a38256bf2762a2c5f9e677c708c](Database%20System/attachments/b91e1a38256bf2762a2c5f9e677c708c.png)

# 3. Keys
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHlr6aQUZeU&t=84s&ab_channel=10MinutesLecturesinComputerScience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHlr6aQUZeU&t=84s&ab_channel=10MinutesLecturesinComputerScience)

We must have a way to specify how tuples within a given relation are distinguished, and this is expressed in terms of their attributes. This is because an important property of a relation (table) in Relational DBMS is:
> [!important]  
> each tuple is distinct, meaning that duplicates are not accepted.  

Actually commercial DBMS relax this requirement and instead allow duplicate tuples.

To safeguard this property, we need to have one or more attributes of a relation that can **uniquely identify every tuple in a relation**.

> [!important]  
> A Key is a set of one or more attributes of a relation that can uniquely identify every tuple in that relation.  

This means that the following query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Emp WHERE Emp_ID = 'E101'
```

must return either 0 or 1 records at maximum. If this happens, `Emp` is a **key**.

Relational DBMS uses three different Key concepts and all have the same property, that is they uniquely determine a record in a table:
- **Super Key**: an attribute, or set of attributes, that uniquely identifies a tuple in a relation. The idea is that it can be any attribute, or any combination of attributes. If you consider the following table:
    ![eb6a8b6e8fc02d95011fa6f8b351bc47](Database%20System/attachments/eb6a8b6e8fc02d95011fa6f8b351bc47.png)
    
	super key can be: `(EmpID)`, `(EmpID, Ename)`, `(EmpID, Dept)`, `(Ename,Dept)`, `(EmpID, Ename, Dept)`, etc.
    
- **Candidate Key**: a super key which no proper subset consists of a super key. Let’s take the five super key considered in the previous bullet point:
    - `(EmpID)`: the proper subset is `Ø`. This subset does not consist in any super key, so `(EmpID)` is a candidate key;
    - `(EmpID, Ename)`: the proper subset consists of `{{EmpID}, {Ename}, {Ø}}`. Out of these three, `EmpID` is already in the list of the super keys, hence `(EmpID, Ename)` is not a candidate key;
    - `(EmpID, Dept)`: the proper subset consists of `{{EmpID}, {Dept}, {Ø}}`. For the same reason as above it cannot be a candidate key.
    - `(Ename,Dept)`: the proper subset consists of `{{Ename}, {Dept}, {Ø}}`. None of them are part of the super key list, hence `(Ename,Dept)` is a candidate key.
- **Primary Key**: one of the available candidate keys can be chosen. In most of cases we choose as primary key a candidate key with a single attribute because it’s easy to deal with. If the candidate key I choose consists of more than one attribute, we can refer to it as **Composite Key**.

Some DBMS automatically create an internal primary key if a table does not define one.

A **Foreign Key** specifies that an attribute from one relation maps to a tuple in another relation.

# 4. Relational Query Languages
A **Query Language** is a language in which a user requests information from the DB. Query Languages can be:
- **Imperative Query Languages**: the user instructs the system to perform a specific sequence of operations on the database to compute the desired result.
- **Functional Query Languages**: the computation is expressed as the evaluation of functions that may operate on data in the database or on the results of other functions.
- **Declarative Query Languages**: the user describes the desired information without giving.a specific sequence of steps or function calls for obtaining that information and the desired information is typically described using some form of mathematical logic. It is the job of the DB system to figure out how to obtain the desired information.

The **Relational Algebra** is a fundamental query language and it forms the theoretical basis of the SQL Query Language.

Query Languages used in practice, such as **SQL**, include elements of the imperative, functional, and declarative approaches.

# 5. The Relational Algebra
The **Relational Algebra** consists of a set of operations that take one or two relations as input and produce a new relation as their result. We can chain operators together to create more complex operations.
- **Unary Operations**: operations involving one relation.
- **Binary Operations**: operations involving a pair of relations.

Remember that since a relation is a set of tuples, **relations cannot contain duplicate tuples**. In practice, however, tables in **DBMS are permitted to contain duplicates** unless a specific constraint prohibits it. In discussing the formal Relational Algebra, we require that duplicates be eliminated, as it required by the mathematical definition of set.

The fundamental operations of Relational Algebra are:

![0f1fbd662836a1109c57fc3bfecc8269](Database%20System/attachments/0f1fbd662836a1109c57fc3bfecc8269.png)
## 5.1. Select Operation
The **Select** operation selects a subset of the tuples from a relation that satisfies a selection predicate.
- Predicates acts as a filter to retain only tuples that fulfils its qualifying requirement.
- Can combine multiple predicates using conjunctions/disjunctions.

**Syntax**: $\sigma_{predicate}(R)$

**Examples**: $\sigma_{dept\_name='Physics'}(instructor)$ or $\sigma_{salary>9000}(instructor)$

Select operation is equivalent to `WHERE` clause in SQL:
```sql
SELECT -- example 1
	*
FROM instructor 
WHERE dept_name='Physics';

SELECT -- example 2
	*
FROM instructor 
WHERE salary>9000
```
## 5.2. Projection Operation
The **Projection** operation generate a relation with tuples that contains only the specified attributes. It aims at:
- Rearrange attributes’ ordering.
- Remove unwanted attributes.
- Manipulate values to create derived attributes.

**Syntax**: $\Pi_{A1,A2, ..., An}(R)$

**Examples**: $\Pi_{ID,name,salary}(instructor)$ or $\Pi_{ID,name,salary/12}(instructor)$

Projection operation is equivalent to `SELECT` clause in SQL:
```sql
SELECT -- example 1
	ID
	, name
	, salary
FROM instructor;

SELECT -- example 2
	ID
	, name
	, salary/12
FROM instructor 
```
## 5.3. Cartesian-Product Operation
The **Cartesian-Product** operation generates a relation that contains all possible combinations of tuples from the input relations.

**Syntax**: $R \times S$

**Example**:

![8ad1697786c729f7ebc8c7774baf361a](Database%20System/attachments/8ad1697786c729f7ebc8c7774baf361a.png)

Projection operation is equivalent to `CROSS JOIN` clause in SQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM R CROSS JOIN S;
```
## 5.4. Join Operation
The **Join** operation generates a relation that contains all tuples that are a combination of two tuples (one from each input relation) with a common value(s) for one or more attributes.

**Syntax**: $(R \bowtie S)$

**Example**:

![f15ac23224f16e590fa15a300dc309ab](Database%20System/attachments/f15ac23224f16e590fa15a300dc309ab.png)

![ecfc39ce619e5a66b6255cd5d51bfb18](Database%20System/attachments/ecfc39ce619e5a66b6255cd5d51bfb18.png)

Projection operation is equivalent to `JOIN` clause in SQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM R NATURAL JOIN S; -- option 1

SELECT * FROM R JOIN S USING (a_id, b_id); -- option 2

SELECT * FROM R JOIN S ON R.a_id=S.a_id AND R.b_id=S.b_id; -- option3
```
## 5.5. Union Operation
The **Union** operation generates a relation that contains all tuples that appear in either only one or both input relations.

**Syntax**: $(R \cup S)$

**Example**:

![2b2d5f888f03d3d50129419386051c0b](Database%20System/attachments/2b2d5f888f03d3d50129419386051c0b.png)

![4c9e0d631b95d6f6622df47da0328694](Database%20System/attachments/4c9e0d631b95d6f6622df47da0328694.png)

Union operation is equivalent to `UNION` clause in SQL:
```sql
(SELECT * FROM R)
UNION
(SELECT * FROM S);
```
## 5.6. Intersection Operation
The **Intersection** operation generate a relation that contains only the tuples that appear in both of the input relations.

**Syntax**: $(R \cap S)$

**Example**:

![ae26394e0d3c466fd423886aabb19c8c](Database%20System/attachments/ae26394e0d3c466fd423886aabb19c8c.png)

Intersection operation is equivalent to `INTERSECT` clause in SQL:
```sql
(SELECT * FROM R)
INTERSECT
(SELECT * FROM S);
```
## 5.7. Difference Operation
The **Difference** operation generates a relation that contains only the tuples that appear in the first and not the second of the input relations.

**Syntax**: $(R - S)$

**Example**:

![a95dd80663b40caa51d2f4c64df9d108](Database%20System/attachments/a95dd80663b40caa51d2f4c64df9d108.png)

Intersection operation is equivalent to `INTERSECT` clause in SQL:
```sql
(SELECT * FROM R)
EXCEPT
(SELECT * FROM S);
```
## 5.8. Extra Operators
* **Rename**: $(\rho)$
* **Assignment**: $(R \leftarrow S)$﻿
* **Duplicate Elimination**: $(\delta)$﻿
* **Aggregation**: $(\gamma)$﻿
* **Sorting**: $(\tau)$﻿
* **Division**: $(R \div S)$﻿
## 5.9. Equivalent Queries
Often there is more than one way to write a query in relational algebra. If you want to find information about courses taught by instructors in the Physics department you can use:

$\sigma_{dept\_name='Physics'}(instructor \bowtie_{instructor.ID=teaches.ID}teaches)$

alternatively:

$(\sigma_{dept\_name='Physics'}(instructor)) \bowtie_{instructor.ID=teaches.ID}teaches$

In the first query the Select (or `WHERE` in SQL) operator restricts `dept_name` to `Physics` after the Join, whereas in the second query the Select operator restricts `dept_name` to `Physics` to the `instructor` relation and then the Join operation is applied.

These two queries are **equivalent** because they return the same result on any DB.

**Query Optimizers** in DB typically look at that result an expression computes and find the **most efficient way of computing that result**, rather than following the exact sequence of steps specified in the query.
